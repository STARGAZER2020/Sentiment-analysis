"Worst product of Motorola. Lenovo have made Motorola very bad.Who have given the camera rating good have no experience with camera.This phone camera is worst than my mi Redmi 2 prime half cost of this phone. This phone camera gave blur effect within smaller distance. I may seriously not satisfied with this product. I may have waited for Redmi note 5 pro.worst experience ever with this phone."
"It's been just a month since I bought this phone and there is a problem with the battery now. It says it requires 15 hours to fully charge the battery and after charging the phone for 3 to 4 hours, the battery drains quickly within a few hours. I want to return this product because I don't think any phone should cause a problem in a month."
"Please listen carefully.dont buy this product.it is a very bad product that I ever seen.I faced problem in using 12 days only .The problem is  charging issue that Don't connect turbo charger .I call moto customer care they deny to replace phone.I went to moto cervice centre they told me you keep your phone for 10-15 days.If a new phone damage in 12 days then company should replace this phone.I hate moto compay's behaviour.I decide to go consumer forum.I hope meet moto in court soon."
"I am using this phone from past 6 months and I can say that it has a lot of basic issues. The battery percentage decreases while charging. The problem is not yet sorted out by moto and lots of user are complaining the same. One more issue which lots of users are experiencing is low incall / outcall speaker volume. The volume is horribly low and you can't hear anything on call in noisy area. You need a very quiet place to call or receive a call. Moto under lenevo is digging its own grave. Moto has not been able to solve any of its issue. You can visit lenevo forum to see lots of complaints from users. I strongly recommend its time to say goodbye to moto and purchase some other mobile."
"2 camera of 13 mega pixcle are failed with my old exchenge 😟 single camera 8 mega pixle with s****ng j7.. Lenovo degraded quality of original moto and put quality like other cheap frode configuration. Quality of camera not good compare / Experience 1st it if u lover of camera and sealfy before buy.."
"Very bad phone. It stopped working after a month Its bootloader was automatically unlocked and the service centre officials say that its a problem with the board and they've had it for 5 days now and I still haven't heard from them. The customer care wasn't even polite I had wait for an bour to tell them what my problem was."
"Don't buy this product it will be a waste of money. Within 15 mins of charging the handset heats up very much. Also using apps for 15 to 20 minutes  continuously the handset heats up. Within  few days I was replaced with a new handset but that was also having the same issue. I don't understand how come Amazon is selling a defective product online. Now it's up too you guys wanna waste your hard own money ."
"Whatever motorola is promoting is not getting delivered in actual.Charger stopped functioning within 3months of purchase.I have checked this issue with G4 and G5 using my friends,all confirmed that charger became non functional within 6 months of time.Please dont try the turbocharger technology in coming phones as you cant meet the expectation in actual."
"I have been using this product since last one year and I m not convinced what moto gave us.Pros- 1.Phone feels solid in hands.2.The single button navigation is provide good features .3. The most I liked in it is the chop chop sensors.Cons-1. The camera quality is not up to the mark which earlier they said about it, however after the software update there are some changes but doesn't change a lot.2.The turbo charger provided with it is stopped working.3. There are some network issues which I feel in it.4. The processor is not so fast after the usage of almost one year."
"Best mobile under 16000... 4gb ram with 64 GBMobile interface and screen is good.  Turbo charger gives your 🔋 battery 100% in just 20-30mins which works up to  8hrCamera wise  rear dual camera  is best for photography .. While front camera lags with clarity.  In daylight  front camera gives good pic but in night although  it has selfie flash it can't give you that much of satisfaction  for selfies.You can do multitasking in 2 windows..Giving rating 4 only for its front camera.  Overall moto g5s plus os best buy under 16000/-"
"I gifted this phone to my younger brother, first it was delivered late though it was booked from a prime account. Second, we got a dead mobile that didn't turn on after being charged for hours. Third, replacement took longer than expected and again it is a defective piece delivered  as nothing can be downloaded using play store. It's the worst experience ever and even now we are not sure whether you people would be taking it seriously and would do the right thing or not. Pathetic."
"Don't go for MOTO. This is one of the worst phone by Motorola. Turbo charger is not working properly. Camera quality is poor than MI phones. Touch not working properly. Suddenly Camera stopped working. Other apps stopped working. Sometimes finger sensor not recognized. Bluetooth gets on automatically. All these problems started after 10-12 days of usage. Replacement policy was closed. Within 3 months i have visited service center 2 times. Waste of money. Very bad experience. I request you MOTO to refund my money back. Please don't buy it at all..."
"Its the best in this mid range section. But the camera quality is not as it was expected. Specially in that portrait mode.Thought motorola was best. But its been more than 6 months, android oreo update hasn't been rolled out yet. After lenovo has bought moto. The level of moto has been decreasing."
"First item came with dead battery. The phone didn’t booted up. Service guy inspected and sent replacement. Screen quality is over saturated. Eyes will feel uncomfort. Battery wuality is low. Not lasting even complete 8-10 hrs with low to moderate use. Phone is too bulky with no special or basic smartphone features. Much better products availabile for this price range"
"I bought this phone at a price of Rs.10 ,750 on prime day sale  with HDFC card benefits, and I am really happy with its performance at that price , if we can recall most phones comes either as 3 GB 32 GB or 4 GB and 64 GB storage variants with different price tags and this phone is pure Android with less blotware moreover for torrenting and watching movies at same time this set is awesome as this would be understood by those who do torrenting via phone and watch a movie at same time .Most phones gets laggy or even frozen I tried with many sets Redmi , Honor, Lenovo etc and if we have the patience ,contact Amazon customer service I replaced my faulty set with their support, than complain about the faulty phone. Overall good but wish I get oreo update before I turn 30....😂😂😂"
"Not worthy product. Product is not great that much as review ratings. Think 3's before u buy this product. APPS CRASHING is biggest BUG of this product and CAMERA No use WORST quality.1st time I got the damaged one which has touch problem and complete apps were crashed.AMAZON has WORST SERVICE they were asking damage report  from our side by going SERVICE CENTER if U got damanged Product for the RETURN or REPLACEMENT , COMPLETE NON SENSE"
"the quality of moto phones have degraded severely after lenovo took over the company. having a pathetic experience with the phone right now. the gorilla glass isnt strong as before, i have no games or huge apps still the phone lags a lot. need to restart it 3-4 times a day to control lagging. do not go for any moto products"
"If you are purchasing this phone to recieve latest updates faster, then go for Mi A1. Three trend of receiving faster updates on Moto devices ends with Moto G5s plus. It's July 2018 (almost nearing to Android p) and we are still waiting for Android O. I did a mistake of purchasing this device. I did a mistake by purchasing this phone is not in the list to get android pie update. Motorola ended support in just a year. Probably this is my last Motorola purchase ever.Also call recorders don't work. No idea why."
"I purchased Moto G5 s Plus in May 2018 and within 2 months one of the SIM slots stopped recognizing the card. As the device is in warranty, visited their service center, their engineers told that the motherboard has a problem which needs to be repaired. Fantastically, motherboards DO NOT come under their replacement policy, and cost of the motherboard us the price of the phone itself.I dont think I can trust amazon to purchase phones now."
"I did not like the product ....Because ....It gets heated up while charging .....n the battery also drains v soon."
"Moto G5S Plus has got everything that you look for in a phone with a budget of 15-16k. And this phone worth every penny of it.Starting from Strong processor,Excellent RAM management,Amazing gaming experience, e.g. ASPHALT 9 runs smoothly on it and playing PUBG with this high screen resolution (and 5.5inch) and brilliant surround sound is really a BOON.Camera works decent (sometimes picture get blur in processing after clicking, software issue needs update) otherwise quality is fine especially Portrait mode is really good.Battery backup is really impressive, 100% charged will definitely last for a day and a half with a fair amount of use.( i.e. calls, WhatsApp ,and even by watching some videos)**In love with turbo charger, 15 mins charging is really sufficient for a backup of 5-6 hours or you can watch a whole movie by that.MOTO ACTIONS, this thing gets me everytime and trust me it'll make your life easier (somewhere somehow).Also, Finger print sensor/scanner is very quick and responsive.So that's it, as I said it got everything BUT the only cons which came across while using it for 5months are:1)Compass sensor missing (hardly matters 😅)2)Metal back and camera bulged part demands a good back cover or a case as it would easily get scratched up (as shown in the only pic shared, rest of the pics of the phone you'll get everywhere) *avoid iPAKY covers for this set, result you just have seen.3) Slow Android update, still running on Marshmallow (as announced, expecting OREO by the end of September).And at last,4) **NO SCREEN CASTING / MIRROR function, which is a big disappointment.Thank you, hope this helps you to make your choice.All The Best!"
"Good for photography and battery has a good life"
"I purchased this phone on 10th April 2018 and now it seems that. I got a defected piece. The cell phone doesn't  works properly and it switches off automatically and when I open it by fingerprint scanner after few hours it hangs up and doesn't works and I have to restart the phone again. The Amazon community didn't register my complaint within 10 days of replacement and now they are not replacing the defected product"
"This product I have bought on 2nd of june. Return window of 15 days only. Device switched got switched off after 20 days of usage so return window was missed. Gave it to official support centre thrice, they changed motherboards and whatnot. Now it got switched off again and the service centre says that due to liquid damage the warranty is void. pay 13000 to replace repair it.I asked service centre why the motherboard was changed, and i was told that the fast charger outlet(something related to charger circuitry was gone) was bad and due to that the motherboard is replaced. WTHI am left with no choice other than just to feel stupid."
"The phone updates constantly but restarts on its own. Had to return the first piece as it was restarting too many times in its own. Screen is very fragile. Will break if you sit with the phones in your front pocket. Camera is pathetic. Dual camera set up is for show. Doesn't work. Battery life is just for one working day. Can't go the next day even with minimal usage. WiFi is weak. Headphones given are trash. Since the screen is curved at the ends, screen protectors don't hang on for long. Water is biggest event. Was driving with two phones in my pocket. This one's WiFi stopped working where's the other phone had no issues at all which by the way was a Samsung. Avoid this phone."
"Poor Quality mobile. Degraded in quality of Moto Mobile after take over by Lenevo. It's also deteriorated like other Lenovo Phone. Before this I had Lenevo K3 Note that was also poor in quality and if I would have known that Moto has been taken over by Lenevo as this was done few month before I purchased this mobile I have never gone for this mobile.Total waste of money."
"This moto/lenevo smartphone is a beast at this price. The screen looks amazing and vibrant which is a 5.5 inch IPS LCD 16 m colour screen with Corning Gorilla glass 3. The processor is Snapdragon 625, 2.0 GHz with Android 7.1(nougat) witch is pretty fast and no problem with multitasking. The best thing about this phone is its camera which comes with 13+13 mp dual rear camera with of course dual LED flash which takes amazing shots. The pictures quality from this camera ia awesome! And for selfie it has 8 mp which also take Amazing selfie with portrait mode. The sound quality is good but could have been better considering the price. Only thing let me down a little bit is the battery which is only 3000mAh but it comes with fast charger which charges the phone fully in about 45-60 mins so that is even Steven😅. Sensor are fingerprint (which is fast and accuracy is good), accelerometer n etc."
"This product Moto G5S Plus is very good and functioning properly.  Sadly, for the past month or so, the charger is not working.Was wondering what to do when I checked and found that the inbox accessories have a six month warranty.Accordingly, I need the phone charger to be replaced.  Pl advise.  Many thanks. T.V. Subramaniyan Mobile: +91 9560840920"
"Moto G5S Plus (Lunar Grey, 64GB)This is the worst ever mobile I have bought. First I received a mobile with faulty battery software, for which I got a new mobile as a replacement. Now after using a month I am facing mobile network fluctuation problem with the replaced one."
"Within 6 months this one started hanging, heating, connectivity issues & all.Moto stop cheating US with poor quality!!Even service Center not in position to resolve !!"
"Though it is a Motorola device which was known for it's blazing fast SW updates but that's not the case with this one anymore. It has been a year now since it was launched into the market but no Android 8.1 till now. It runs on Android 7.1.1 which still is very buggy. Battery has not been optimized well, as it shows falls battery percentage. I would not recommend this phone at this point now. You can have a look at the new Nokia devices. They are actually doing what Motorola was suppose to do. Or even Xiomi phones are giving a really very good value for money. Which is not the case with Motorola."
"I would recommend to purchase Vivo or MI and never go for Motorola brand.There are ongoing issues with charger. When you address this to service centre they put their software and make more mobile more worst and give it you for use.Dept effect is not seen even after update.Turbo charger doesn't work after 15 days of purchaseHighly highly dissatisfied and disappointed."
"Very good phone.. Pic quality is superb, snaps are taken in a jiffy.. just like an iPhone.But I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a Native Photos app but uses Googles Photo app.Also, not many Security features are available to safegaurd the phone from Hackers. These have become a Standard feature in Samsung Phones. Which could be a primary reason that when I plan to upgrade from this unit, I might prefer to buy a Samsung instead of G6 Plus."
"Build Quality Good. Its slim Initially i found it difficult to hold & fear of slipping from hand as it has big size but you feel good becoz of metallic body & front curved glass. Finger print sensor is good. Camera is ok. Speed is ok. Rear camera is bulging out so there is fear of getting scratched however company claims glass to be of good quality, It depends on Individual usage also. I have a very rough n tough usage so i have purchased a diary type  cover."
"I have been using Samsung phones since long but after buying this product I feel its not only value for money but has more features then any other phone available in the market. Processor is fast while multitasking.  The picture quality is superb and the camera is brilliant in still and video shoots. It has a good battery backup and a quick charger is fantastic. Security features are great with ample storage space. I would definitely recommend this phone."
"This phone is clearly of more worth. I was thinking of buying Mi A1 but after watching many reviews decided to go for it. Best phone under 20k bracket."
"it is a grate phone.it cost only 14000 INR . it has 4GB RAM and 64GB internal memory expandable up to 128GB. which is grate in this price point.its has 13+13MP dual back camera (f/2.0, dual LED flash) and 8MP front facing camera with flash . its screen is 13.97cms (5.5-inch) Full HD (1080 x 1920) capacitive touchscreen with Gorilla Glass 3 protection.its runs on  Android v7.1 Nougat operating system with 2.0GHz Snapdragon 625 octa-core processor which is grate for multitasking . but the most important is battery 3000mAH Lithium-ion battery with 15W Turbo Charging with only  20 minute charging it runs about 6-7 hours ."
"HEATING PROBLEM . I bought phone today, its heating up very fast. On using any app or using youtube , its getting heated up. I appreciate Aamazon for the fast delivery though."
"good mobile...camera was the USP of this mobile...but not able to impress with it yet.i think the camera of G5 plus is better..dual cameras are ok ok...but the built is really cool and corning gorilla glass another good thing...Better than Redmi phones since moto is a more reliable....You can go for it"
"The phone is truly efficient and has amazing features. The camera, display and other functions are superb. It is totally worth the price. After getting some system updates, there are no further heating problems while charging or using it. Love this phone. <3And I received the phone within two days of ordering, and in perfect condition. So kudos to Amazon.in!"
"U ppl sud say that its jst a ""Chinese Product"" and no warranties can be claimed other than manufacturing defects and remove other lines. Worked swiftly with no problems for 9 months. Aftr 10 months i faced problems while charging. It used to charge normally sumtyms and wud take long tym otherwise. So i went to customer care centre and they told that it has an internal short circuit and the charging pin has thus damaged and so i can not get warranty benefits. Now was that done by me intentionally!!! Nobody does that ryt....Also they said that my screen has a slight scratch...and thats also i can't get warranty claimed for that thing either. Its ok then. Nxt tym before selling your products jst mntion that u sell low grade chinese goods and don't boast that ur screen is shatter proof or something else..I earlier gave it a 5 star rating...reduced it to 2 star for service quality only."
"The product I got had a white spot on the display...so amazon gave me a full refund...Thanks amazon..About the product, at this price (12000 rupees) there is no better phone than this one. It took 3 days for amazon for the return process to complete and I tested the device. I am writing this review by judging it for the price of 12000 not the original 17000 rupees price.BUILD QUALITY:The first thing you will notice is the build quality. The full metal body is amazing to hold, doesn't slip, the camera bump looks beautiful (use microfibre cloth to clean as small threads gets stuck in it). Simply the phone is beautiful with a strong build quality.CAMERA:In this price range, it is the best camera phone. Daylight shots are amazing and night shots are good enough, not that great but good. The bokeh effect is also amazing...after updating the camera app it gets better and oreo update is coming soon that too will increase the camera performance. There are also various modes to play with. The camera provides realistic colour. Some people say the color is yellowish but I think that it replicates the exact color that I can see with my eyes ( sunlight is yellow not white..duh). The macro shots also look great but you cannot get too close to the subject. I liked the front camera very much. The front panaroma (group selfie) is amazing. The front flash lightens up the darkest rooms. Front cam also has the manual mode. Without beautification the camera provides realistic image. With beautification it doesn't make your skin like plastic and white like on other phones. The video performance is amazing on every mode.SOFTWARE:The stock Android with moto apps. Works like a charm. Nuff said.BATTERY and PERFORMANCE:The 3000 mAh battery gives a full day typical use from 100% to 0%. If you use phone a lot for camera, gaming etc. it works for about 6-7 hours. If you are gaming only, it works for about 4-5 hours (while playing PUBG) *Please note that pubg is still not optimized well even for the flagship phones. PUBG shows no lag. If you want to play games for a whole day like me, that is where the turbo charger comes in. It can charge your phone from 0 to 100 in just 1hr 20 mins. Average apps like Facebook, Instagram etc works flawlessly. There is no lag in the phone.I had to go to college, phone was at 20%, charged it for 30 mins, and then again it was 65%. People complaining about battery are not considering that they are getting a turbo charger.Phone gets warm while charging. So don't play games whilst charging for a longer battery health.SOUND QUALITY:Speakers had good bass and treble and were loud enough to hear in a crowded room. It has a 3.5 mm jack with good audio output.DISPLAY:Display is very good with sharp images. It is slightly warmer in color but that too will change with the oreo update or  you can use any other app to change color temperature. The moto display is very useful as it doesn't have a physical notification light. It also saves battery.So in conclusion at 12000 rupees...the phone is amazing buy without thinking twice before it gets out of stock. And if you have any issue you can easily return the phone and get your money back. I had the white spot in display issue. They gave me my money back and again I have ordered this phone.I hope this time I will not get any of that issue.P.S: I love the moto boot animation."
"I had a moto G4 plus earlier, was pretty happy with that phone so thought of going with next moto phone G5s plus.Some reason the phone set i got is not good in performance.1. Did not notice issues initial few days, but after a week phone gets hung so many times, in spite of i have updated phone with all updates it was flashing. Mot many app installed.2. Unlock sensor sometime is not responsive3. Had to restart phone 2/3 times a day, it really irritates.4. Got a faulty charger with phone, it only shows power sign (that too goes and come back)5. Will visit service center for these issues."
"I am using this mobile for an year below are my pros & ConsPros.1. Good Processor. No heating/Hanging issues2. Good Camera - 13+13 dual gives good bokeh effect3. Display/Sound - Display & Sound quality are too good . I haven't faced any issues yet4. Battery life - Decent battery life for Normal usage.5. Turbo Charging - Charges full within 1.30 hrs.Cons.1. OS Update is late. Still didn't get oreo Update . Mobile will not have Pie update2. Taking Screenshot is big head ache3. Hybrid slot. but 64GB is enough for normal usage."
"The phone is great if you are tight on budget and yet want something that gives a competent performance for daily tasks. But for me, the phone looks great and feels good; and works quite efficiently.Now post 8 months of usage, I would like to say my major complaint with Motorola is they are so so late with security and system updates! It is frustrating! Given they released Android Oreo 8.1 updates in May 2018 for this handset, it is still in some Soak Test phase as their customer executive says, which they mentioned can take any amount of time. Only after that will they release the update!"
"It's worst I bought this phone on 25th sep and one month it was working fine post that it supports only 2g and I did factory reset and did the manual network settings then also it was not working and am not able to make or receive calls. The same sim I have inserted in one plus and it was working fine in that handset. I don't know what should I do with that....."
"This phone is overheated when I am 15 mints call to continue as well as when we to go for the battery charge same issue of overheat and right now phone charger is not working, this issue facing last 2 month.When went to the authorized service center of Moto G in Karnal and Gurgaon, then not support and deny for support due to the original bill. As per received mail from your end or create a new bill from click option and find a new invoice copy, but authorized service center is demanding for original phone bill with mentioned the EMI number on bill paper. From shared you end we are not getting those type of bill which mentions these EMI number so please help me out and support as soon as possible and share the original bill or take alternative solution. ( Phone under warranty )Please find the attached phone invoice copy for your reference."
"Works well considering its specifications but the dual camera is a letdown, don't expect big things. The battery life is definitely not as great as expected for a 3000maH piece. There is much room for improvement in the one-button nav function."
"Pictures are captured at par level, yes using the dual camera modes.No dual speakers like Moto G 2nd generations.Though speaker during call are loud but for music with 320kbps quality isn't so loud in open environment.In terms of battery this is a complete disappointment. With a morning charging of 100% by evening 7 o clock it drops down to 20% that too when I am not gaming.Though one thing this phone it does handle hardcore gaming graphics well. There is no rise in temperature. Which remains only plus point of this phone."
"Being a Moto fan and having used Moto G2 for almost a year, I thought I was in for some really good camera (as Moto G2 also had a good camera and this one claimed to be a much better one, with it's dual-focus rear camera). But to my utter disappointment, the pictures this phone takes are in no way amazing. Colors do not come proper. Bright light photography is good though but low light is a pain, including well lit indoors.Otherwise the phone feels sturdy in hands, and can survive a few drops; has a good battery life (if used continuously for talking and playing around apps, it lasts a day or more). The phone does not hang and gives good performance. It heats while charging, especially if it is being used while charging, which is expected."
"Good productI purchased with by back of Moto G4 S plus I received a faulty deviceBut after me talking with Amazon representatives they have replaced a new device within 24 hrsThe team support was very goodThey are understandable personsThank you Amazon"
"Pros: Very good build quality with a nice premium feel.  Phone feels fast and responsive  No bloatware, and whatever Motorola has added are really useful  Decent CameraCons: That nice metallic feel has a downside, the phone is very slippery. I almost dropped it a couple of times  The fingerprint reader is over-sensitive.  I can feel it in my pocket when I move around and it get pressed to my chest.  Took me a while to  figure out why the phone keeps vibrating in my pocket, when there are no notifications!!!!  No notification light, coming from a flagship Samsung I really miss that.  I am not too impressed with the Moto display function.An update: Overall still happy with the phone, but very very DISAPPOINTED that there is no Oreo update yet.  Reducing to three stars."
"Sleek, sturdy, smooth & suave. Great turbo-powered battery. Efficiently running without any hitch so far. A commendable product brought to my door by Amazon. The audio headset is less than ordinary though, it should have matched the superiority of the phone."
"Solid device. No heating.nice camera and good battery life. Screen is bright and nice color reproduction. Cam clarity is good but colors are bit saturated and not much use of dual cam setup.performance is okay for day to day use.fast charging is really fast until 90% then slows down.battery lasts a day and half."
"Absolutely amazing phone by Motorola.The camera is Good. Not superb. But good one for the cost.The battery backup is good. I play NFS racing games, all the day internet is on and keep on checking news, whatsapp, hangout, lots of emails etc. A full charge in morning and its still 30-40 % remaining till late night.Turbo charger is the best thing given by Motorola. Charges up mobile super fast.Fast multitasking and processing.Go for it as the device is awesome for the cost."
"Overall a good device till now. It has FM radio in it, that's one of the USP of  most of mid range phone (Its not mentioned anywhere in amazon/moto website).All features works good as expected and stunning finger print response and no lags with so many apps running."
"Good product with limitations like we can only put 2 Sims or 1 sim and 1 sd card. If you use 2 sims sim2 don't have 4G selection option only 3G. My recommendation go for it. Advise is relook into this product price."
"The delivery was spot on...was delivered in 48 hours of being ordered. As to how good the phone is, will have to use for a while to confirm...but this is my 3rd moto g - the other 2 have followed the same pattern - good use for about a year, then something breaks, I get the outer cover replaced after which the phone is fine for another 6 months, then it begins dialing people on my speed dial automatically at which point I replace the phone :)...this phone looks good and for the first 48 hours of usage, all is well"
"I have been used Moto G5s plus last 20 daysSatisfied -Charging system is turbo that can be charged my phone within 15 minutes 30 to 40 % ..Processor speed is GoodNot Satisfied -Camera has not captured cleanup..Rear camera not captured properlyCamera has been quickly scratched.Totally waste of money, Don't buy this phone"
"Had ordered this phone for my mom. As usual Amazon order arrived on time. It was properly packed, box was sealed and product had everything expected packed in. No issues there at all. Only grouse is that Motorola is extremely slow to push software and security updates despite the phone having near stock android. Also, the camera is good, but don't have huge expectations thinking its a dual camera setup. It's after all a budget phone and so photos are good, but far from great."
"Screen cracked without any drop / fall. Manufacturer / service centre not taking responsibility.Feel cheated as Motorola is not ready to accept that this could be manufacturing defect.Did come across other customers on the internet who had faced similar problems. Tried posting links for forums where other customers have raised this issue, but amazon is permitting me to post that review."
"After using for 3 weeks here is my take on the phone .- It does all the basics perfectly, Battery life is quite impressive.- Love the Moto mods such as ambient display of notifications etc,they work flawlessly.- Bugs in Bluetooth software is causing battery drain ( hopefully it will get fixed in next update)- NFC works, however is not as fast as you would expect. - Dual camera implementation could be better than current.- Random restarts are occurring of late."
"It is a good phone I ever use phone.I used REDMI A1,samsung but I love this phone.What I like Most about this phone:RAM - Just amazing. Since it has 4GB of Ram and comes with an OS almost close to stock android there is more than enough for day to day usage.Processor - SD 625 is known for it's efficiency and now I know why. Smooth and lag free experience even when playing high end graphic games. I have played MC5 and Asphalt so far.Screen - It's awesome, color reproduction is superb. It feels as if I'm using galaxy s6.Call quality is top notch, didn't face any issue so far. On call volume is decent enough.Battery depends on users so there isn't much to discuss. For me I would say it's okish, could have been better."
"For 13K, it's value for money!!Since I'm coming from Nexus 5, thought the display could had been better.Not sure why the flash light they've provided is warm color and not white led color like any other mobile. This gives a different effect on the photos took with flash ON, some may like it but I guess most wouldn't.Everything else is on par and the Moto gesture features are cool & handy."
"The mobile battery is a joke. It has been exactly 1 month since I have got the device, the performance and battery backup and power charging were pretty good until the mobile's battery got screwed. Now the device takes 5-6 hours to charge despite turbo charging and gets discharged in about the same amount of time which is really annoying. I have to go to any moto service centers to get this problem sorted out. I must say I am very disappointed with the poor battery performance. Apparently a lot of people seem to have the same battery problem so my advice would be to first go through all the customer reviews regarding battery performance and then make a decision."
"In this range it's best phone.  Excellent gaming performance without any lag and long lasting battery backup. You can use it for 2 days on normal consumption. On heavy usage 10 hours which is quite sufficient. I'm bit worried of heat up issue. Sometimes it's very much though it's rare. Overall  mind blown phone."
"Good looking phone, but back of it is very slippery. Have to be extra careful in handling.Also what I didn't like is, there was no instruction manual in it. Not even starting up the phone."
"This is the best mobile I have used till nowI liked below- Camera- Display- Battery (Even though its 3000mAH) it gives one day with 100% charge- RAMI didn't like- Headset came with mobile. its very cheap quality and sound clarity is very low- Phone voice receiver volume could be better. Felt little lessI am not heavy games player. I am just normal mobile user"
"Been using it four months. It's not that good. The dual camera doesn't take good pics in night or low lighting. Even the daylight pics are not so great.Processing has become slow in just three months. Google maps take time to load. (whether on wifi or 4G network).Needless to say, the phone feels quite bulky/heavy.Battery last for about 12 hours.The original build is very slippery - definitely needs a cover with better grip to handle. Otherwise it slips out and falls too often.Screen size is good and viewing experience is good."
"Pros:1. Design and build quality is nice.2. Stock android experience.3. Display is crisp, colors production is great.4. Sound quality is nice.Cons:1. Camera performance could have been better. Sometimes captures blurry photo.2. Priced a bit high for the hardware as there are no extra hardware advantage over the previous G5 plus.3. No android updates.4. Though it supports 4K recording but not that great with it's image stabilization.5. Battery is not much for heavy usage"
"Love this Moto.. SD625 is doing wonders.. I being a heavy user from playing games for 4 hours daily and watching movies and surfing you tube , it goes completely for one day with around 20% of battery still left out..😊Front camera is superb but the primary camera is just average. Considering the dual camera still it doesn't take that good pics as compared to Remind Note 4 (I am using note 4 for last 2 months).. But I think there is a lot to explore in camera so will post a revised review after one month of use.For those complaining on the missing E Compass... It locks the location instantly without any issues.. M not sure if you are on a constant travel mode so complaining 😊..This phone is super fast n screen is awesome.I am happy to move from Moto G3 to Moto G5 S Plus.."
"Bought this phone 5 months ago and it's working well. One time charge can last for almost 16-18 hours depending upon the data consumption. Charges to 100% within 70 minutes when completely drained. Rear cam is better compared to the front cam. Earphones provided with the phone are not as good, better get one of another brand. Phone is slippery to hold with one hand, phone cover must. The body is robust, even after falling 2-3 times; no scratches or dents."
"I bought this phone 2 weeks back. As if now, I am enjoy ung using this phone. Only thing troubles me is the battery. I was using redmi3s prime ratou er which was of 4300 mah battery and this us if 3000 mah battery. So, the battery life wise, i am little discomfortable. Turo charging is really a boom. What if the charge suddenga fail a day? Now I sm in that phase. After 2 weeks of laage, suddenly my phone charge stoppen working now. Thats is what trigger es me to write this review.. friends, think rice about battery before taking this phone. Performance wise, I give 5 out of 5. Awesome phone if you ignore battery issues."
"Disadvantage :-1. Mobile is getting heat up while using for long time.2. Battery back up is also not good.3. No, update for Oreo 8.1 until July 2018.4. Notification LED is not available.5. Little bulky than other mobile, but it's having metallic body. So, that's ok.Advantage1. Processor is really fast.2. Metal body look is adorable.3. Camera quality is better than other phone in between range.4. Picture Resolution is high.5. Fingerprint sensor is really fast. Best part is that mounted on front, it's also work as navigation key.6. Turbocharger works pretty good."
"I am using moto g5s plus for the past 5 months, i am more than satisfied.The camera is simply amazing with additional features like panorama and depth enabled.There is no need of a separate camera, when we have moto in our hand.Usage is really good because of 4gb RAM. Sound quality is excellent."
"Received the product early..But there was problem with camera after 1 week..So had demanded for replacement..But back panel of  replaced product had some scratches..Finally asked for refund but the amazon person came with invoice of earlier (1st one ) phone.This happened for 4 times..Finally didn't get refund..Using the same phone..But one thing liked the phone software and working.."
"I don't have an option to give less than one rating.The most funny part of Moto is it is struggling to Oreo(Android 8)update for 2 year old and 1 year old devices.But it has released the list of devices which gets Pie(Android 9)😂😂😂😂😂Coming to the mobile.Worst battery and very bad performance.Camera is less than an average..Moto is becoming worser, day by day after Lenovo taken up.Probably battery issue could be resolved some extent with Oreo.But no Oreo update yet, G5S plus users are annoyed, waiting for the Oreo update.Sound Ok ok."
"Next day delivery is good. Working well charging fastly. Charge stands continuously for 12 hours with net in on position. OS is user friendly. Comes with tray pin,charger with cable and ear phone."
"It's a great phone for the price. Purchased it for my father. For his usage, it is fast, no lagging, great battery backup, and not to forget, gets the updated android.Camera is great on the price you pay. Compared to the competition on this price segment, it has the best camera. Love the Depth focus feature."
"Been using it for a month now. Awesome phone No lags at all. Beter than all other phones in the price bracket. But the dual camera is not that great. The dual camera in mia1 is better than on the moto g5s plus. But in all other segments the moto is much better than Mi. The battery is good. It lasts for around 12-14 hours meaning of works for a day but needs a charge at night. I have played many heavy games like shadow fight 3 and  asphalt 8 airborne and there are seriously no lags at all. The phone heats up ab bit when it is charging but that's with all other fast charging phones so can't complain about that. I love the chop chop and other gestures of the phone. Really helpful. The front camera is good is daylight conditions but the quality deteriorates when in artificial lighting conditions."
"Camera is not that much good in low lighting worst performance and the main Problem​ is in wifi issue disconnected randomly over all not worth to buy"
"The finest that you will find. The camera doesn't quite match with the hype it got but rest everything is top notch. I was an iPhone user before but Moto G5s Plus made me forget apple and love Motorola​... Must buy if u want some extraordinary features in this price range..PS: AMAZON'S ONE DAY DELIVERY IS PATHETIC"
"The purchase process at Amazon and the delivery went very smoothly within the committed time. For the cash-back (VISA) on the purchase, it took some time and a follow-up, which Amazon should try to streamline as it is an unecessary irritant. The Product itself (Moto G5sPlus) is as per specs & reviews that I had studied on-line and largely fulfills my expectations. The camera is good but is certainly below par compared to the specs and the hype. Loud speaker sound quality is also disappointing. The Moto software is relatively bare compared to RedMi Note 4  (which I also ordered at the same time on Flipkart) but that may also be the cause of the relatively shorter battery endurance of RedMi Note 4 (though Moto G5s Plus battery also has a 25% higher mAh rating). The moto is priced at about 60;% premium on RedMi Note4 (Rs 16000 Vs Rs 10,000), which I find a bit too much for almost identical specs. I also bought a Chevron hard back-case for the Moto which gives the Moto a solid look & feel."
"It's been couple of months since i boight this product and it is already facing issues with the battery. I mean lenovo has really messed up what moto has created unded google. It's no use to buy a moto device anymore"
"Excellent.....battery backup not up to the expectation... good quality camera..Front camera not up to the mark.. super build quality.... turbo charging is very promising.."
"Phone is decent ,rear camera as well.front camera has little issue with clarity,but can be improved by camera apps on google store.actually i wanted best rear camera so this mobile is best for it ,for photography as well.I did not face any issue with battery.yes it little warm behind phone while charging but overall while using normally it never heats up.fingerprint sensor is cool.This phone should be handled very nice else camera may damage if you drop .Well the amazon delivery service is good ,product was not damaged and they check in front  of youThank you : )Best thing is it comes under budget with best camera and good memory."
"I ordered this phone just before one day of launch and got this very next day. Thank you amazon for superfast delivery.Coming to phone, I ordered it as my primary phone but recently i have started using it as secondary phone and as per me the performance is satisfactory. I will not tell the technical details but yes will write the things that i observed and can cause trouble.1. Phone camera lags badly in depth mode, hoping for a software update from Motorola.2. Sometime apps crashes when you are using them.3. Phone call quality is good but speaker volume is less.4. Battery works pretty fine, with heavy usage you can get phone working for a full day.5. Photos taken from camera are crisp and you can record 4k video as well. But camera bump on back is not a good idea.6. Phone feels slippery without cover.7. Fingerprint sensor is amazingly fast.8. Phone heats up while charging, this could be due to turbi charging but not very sure.9.  Screen quality is pretty impressive.Rest apart phone is good not great but at this price what you will expect  ?"
"Moto g5s plus over all a good mobile,or u may say an average mobile.camera and sound quality does not meet my expectations,it can be enhanced,Dolby atmos is missing.I bought due to its Snapdragon 625 processor,which is fast and battery efficient.I really does not like it's camera bump,it can be beautifully crafted like in mia1 and like others...Overall a good mobile u may go for it....."
"It's been month only when I hold this phone, I felt very good that time because it gives you prime feeling prima facie but after some time I started realising that it's touch is not good as it was month ago, it has started lagging and some time hangs too, it's sensors and hardwares are below average that's why it's performance is below average. Don't buy this.....go buy dummy phone but don't buy this."
"Ok I am writing my review after using this phone for almost 50 days.No separate folders for camera photos and for songs. Radio also not get the signal or not accepting the Indian stations.Heat issue is there:  I was using a phone has mediatek processor and it has the heating issue so I decided to buy snapdragon but the issue remains the same.Camera: inspite of having the dual camera performance is less than the average.Hang issue is also there and not that much fast what I was expecting in snapdragon processor.The back side camera is too much out from the surface so I need to take precautions while keeping down."
"The product was delivered as described. The build quality is good and sturdy. The camera is good maybe not excellent for many, but good for this price range. There is no lag and runs multiple functions simultaneously. The display legibility is good at normal light, but not that good at sunlight. the sound quality is good for speaker and headphone too. In all a good product at this price range."
"Meseging app not working i will meet my oprator store tomorrow and if not fix that issue i have to repplace instrument.Now its working(sms) because i change simcard to nano vodafone resume sms service after 28 hours!Instrument is ok nice colour and build fast tooOnly i font like on moto is big camere windo.Otherwise very cute phone."
"This mobile is no doubt a very good one. It's a must purchase. I have used Moto g 4+ and now I have bought this one. M totally satisfied with the mobile phones. In love with this brand. Amazon plays an important role, in providing attractive discounts and offers. I suggest everyone to go for this brand. Brand which actually satisfies you. Say hello to Moto, and if you are thinking of buying this handset then plz go for it without any hesitation.Thank u soo much Amazon.Love Amazon.❤️"
"Before purchasing I was wondering ifThis phone was if it looks better than the MotoG5Plus? Yes, it really does look very nice, all-metal build! Feels very solid in hand.Does it have any lag? None which I could notice.Is the Camera any good? It takes decent pictures, very good for a person like me (not a photography enthusiast)"
"Within two days i started facing issue with touch.Sometimes it works , sometime doesn't , specially top area. I tried two phone both have same issue with touch ,Touch doesn't work on top area .You won't be able to open your apps which are in first row.Lenevo ruined Motorola.Better go with other brand except lenevo and Motorola, now no longer best mobile brand."
"The heating problem is making the handset difficult to use specially while charging. After using it for 4 months now, i have realized it is not a good choice as applications hang a lot which makes it slower as compared to other smart phones."
"I have read few reviews about the overheating issue for this phone. Was Little dubious initially. Looks like they are all correct about over heating during turbo charging. Having said that, the rest of the features are quite outstanding when compared to it's competitors. Quite a winner in it's segment."
"Purchased this mobile from Amazon on 19th March, 2017. Picture quality is really good. The 2nd best camera phone after Redmi note 5 pro if your budget is below 15K. Sound quality, display and overall performance of the mobile is really good. Good mobile for heavy game users. Only con is that the battery life is poor, but that con is not a major problem as moto g5s plus comes with a turbocharger which charges your phone from 0-100% within 1½ hrs.Highly recommended if your budget is below 15K and you're looking for a mobile which has a good brand name. ☺️"
"Contacts can only be saved to Google mail I'd. There is no option for saving the contact on phone memory. There should be an option in the hands of user where he/she wants to save. It should not be forced which is not customer friendly. Rear camera output is not that good as said or publicised. Front camera output is still better. Processing is not that fast. Only plus point is 64gb internal memory. Overall it is just a normal phone. Cost seems to be bit on higher side. Buying Moto g 5s with external memory card can b better option at much lower cost.Think twice & compare fr better deal. Company is just twisting & presenting things differentlyThanks"
"Best phone in price 16000.Camera is Good not like DSLR but it's average good camera..Speed of the mobile is incomparable with this range.. look is also good.. touch is awesome.. sensor is awesome.. best thing is turbo charging.. from 0 to 100% it takes 1 hr 42 mins..And 3000 mAh is sufficient for one day.. display is very good.. brightness is good.. and main thing is don't expect too much from camera.. camera is good also I don't say camera is bad but don't expect too much from camera"
"Motorola G5s plus which is just 3 months old it suddenly got dead and not working anymore and there was heating problem while charging and turbo charging does not get worked always ,sometimes it takes whole day for charging and phone gets restart at times.At the end its not worth to have Motorola G5s plus the way it is working."
"Its been one month i m using this phone...!!! and really Motorola disappoints me in the camera field in the comparison of Mi A1 the camera is not upto mark...Although the built quality and processor is good...Earlier i m using Moto g4 plus which was really a good phone but i think Moto g5s plus is not a major upgrade instead of that phone.....Phone Doesn`t heat that much while in heavy gaming and charging too and battery optimization is really good you can use almost 12 hours with Data usage with full battery charge.The major upgrade of Dual camera(Bookeh effect) is not upto  mark even after 2 updates of motorola camera Hope so Motorola fix it as soon as possible but i reccommend if you want to upgrade your phone for main reason of camera go for mi A1 and if you are a Moto fan like me Go for this Phone...!!!tell me in comments if this is helpful for you or Not...!!!"
"With minimal apps my phone restarts at least once a day - I see light glowing on my desk and see that the phone is rebooting - randomly without any activity, even with data and wifi off. This happened mostly at night time so far and so not much inconvenience faced. I am not sure if this is a software reboot to clear up memory contents once in a day when the phone is idle or there is a bug out there. In any case I do not like my device taking charge without my approvals"
"After 1 years of usingPro:•Moto has given many camera updates and potriat improvements.•Photo quality in day light is decent•Turbo Charging at its best till nowCon:•Promised that they will give oreo update within 4 months but till now they haven't given.•App crashes rarely•Poor picture quality at night"
"Don't go for this mobile. Not at all receiving the signal and call quality is very bad. Being a 4gb ram, hanging frequently and low battery. Because of signal problem, battery is draining dramatically. Wast of  money only"
">Getting networking issues again n again.. network connections has been disabled automatically, it is not rectifying after restarting the phone also, i couldn't able to make a call in emergency time and am getting struggled on the time  totally disappointed.>VOLTE is not available. Network speed is  very low for Both WiFi and Mobile data, Providing like 3g Speed> Camera performance is average not worth for 15000rs.>Battery backup is average.>Turbo charging performance is average>headset pointer its not suitable for all the headphones, Please check and buy>while listening music or watching videos, if i lock the screen also the sound will come out"
"Im using this phone from around 1 month and my review for this phone is as follow-•Performance-too fast no doubt 4 gb ram is working really good•Camera - amazing debth mode is also too good but it is not good as iphone 7+ but it really captures great images and while recording videos the video stabilization works great which is lacking in mi a1•Battery-turbo charging is damn too fast  and the battery backup is is quite decent it can long for one day"
"It's so good product no heating issue no hanging issue so fast we can say just next to iPhone but the only thing is that camera is good only in daylight only it's not good at night so who wants to go to photo shoot at night I would suggest you to take your camera or good diffuesd light with you so that you can capture good pictures of your moments"
"Best phone I purchased in my life...Phone camera is too good if compare to Redmi A1.The metallic design is awesome.Price is very low.Phone battery is not too much but easily we can spend a day.Phone charges very fast as it support turbo charging.I don't have words to express this phone because the phone quality , features and design is awesome.If you have budget of 16,000 then go for it.....it worth it....."
"Awesome ...phone ..if u use. This phone ...u just love it ...design wise ...it looks like iPhone apple phone ...camera quality is superb ..nd the internal device is u got ...approx 51 gb and ram 3.6 gb is used ..which is far better than any other phone in this range ...awesome phone ..take selfie or anything u just love it with this camera..little bit battery capacity is low..but most important thing is the turbo charger which charge the phone in just 1 hr.. completely ..."
"I'm a moderate user. I liked the device very much performance is fluid and smooth.I'm satisfied with the camera.Only thing i did not like is it's battery 🔋. I feel they should have given a bit more bigger battery considering the screen size.Although it runs a full day but it could have been better !!!"
"Best phone at an affordable range. I choose this over Xiaomi Mi A1. I like the speed, the screen resolution, the sound quality(suprisingly) and my favourite the fingerprint sensor. It is very fast and almost recognises immediately. I like the fingerprint sensor in the front rather than in the back because when you are working and your phone is lying on the desk and you need to unlock it, you don't have to pick the phone. Just press the fingerprint sensor. That is super convenient. Moto actions are convenient. The camera is not that impressive considering it is 13+13 Mp. Talking about the battery, charging is very fast due to the turbo charger and the battery last fairly a day, but if you use you phone extinsevely for watching videos online or heavy gaming it will last upto maximum 14 hours. Hope this helps."
"I am reviewing after 6 month phone is good and working satisfactory .But my phone stop charging and I visited to service centre Chandigarh they told me that charging jack not working and if I want to repair that whole motherboard will change and that cost will be around 13000  second day I shown to a local repair centre he told me that nothing is broken and h repaired phone easily .Lenova is immorse the name of Motorola."
"Everything is good only two problems are there.1) wifi gets disconnected when I connect it to my Dell laptop . And it happens within 1 minut of connection and after that it only gets connected and disconnected. My laptop connects with each and every wifi except moto g5splus2)camera is only for day time and good light . Not a good camera but average quality pics are taken by it in medium to low light.3) speaker are loud ohh sorry loudest of any android I purchased till now and yes speaker sound is that much loud that sometime sound has some cracks and irritation in it"
"I am using this phone since last 6 to 7 months and I m completely dissatisfied with the performance of MOTO,No doubt MOTO is enhancing their phones but they are far away from other brands and basic features are also missing which Sony mobile provides within same budget,Good:- CameraBad:- Low performance of batter- Device does not have inbult audio setting- It opens the app automatically- Low performance of 4GB ram- it requires frequent restartBetter to go for well known brands either Sony, Lenovo etc."
"I bought this with an exchange for my Redmi 3s Prime which I used for around a year and three months. I got a good exchange price for that from Amazon around 4400 bucks which is almost 50% of what I had purchased it for, I also got around 1000 bucks off on hdfc card, eventually I paid 8600 bucks which I think is a steal deal. The phone is very well built and looks premium. The features are also pretty good especially the gestures. I think Moto phones are great value for money. Thanks Amazon."
"Good built quality diaplay is great, but Moto has to improve more in software updates. It seems to be slow in getting Android updates & offline maps(GPS) does work just because this phone does not have e-compass in it. Rest all is fine nothing much say about. Screen cast does not work at all. & also the camera bump glass is broken now."
"writing my review after 4 months of usagepros:1) Smooth performance,2)Ram management is awesome.....we can easily run 10 apps in background3)after the recent updates camera has updated alot4)great battery backup with turbo charger5)Snapdragon 625 & cortex A53 makes the device run smooth cons:1) no oreo update till now,moto is becoming lazy these days2)it slightly heats during charging but its not a mojor problem...i think it heats up due to turbo charger"
"Camera is really great, given the price.Battery charging and backup are awesome.Build quality seems solid enough.Pretty fast, combination of 4gb-snapdragon 635. Videos and games are seamless.Unlike MI phones, no problems with call quality.However, some problems with Glass. A very small fall will break it. This problem is discussed in other moto forums as well.Google Assistant is erratic sometimes. Doesn't function as expected.Also, cast not supported for any other device except Chromecast. This is bad if you have a smart tv."
"It's working pretty good As per my expectationsBt there is no thing like Fast battery charging it's just normal.Bt all other things like camera, screen ,speaker volume, Fingerprint scanner, battery backup,even design are very goodBt you just need to buy a back cover for that camera bump!"
"A nice phone under 20k bucks. Feels really premium, thanks to the metal body design. It is sleek, yet comfortable to hold. Camera is great, but you need to be carefull with the camera glass. Depth mode is so so. Not as great as that you would get from DSLRs, well thats an obvious. For that DSLRs are there in the market. But the depth mode acts great if the object is closer to camera and has a crisp boundary line against the background and overall it acts better than any other third party apps. This phone would definitely attract attention of others looks wise. There is a camera bump at the back which would make you feel extra cautious at the beginning and would make you search a softer surface to keep your phone, but this can be taken care of by using a back cover. Battery is good I would say, 100% charge at 7a.m. would last till 8:00p.m. till you get 15% charge warning. It gets turbo charging and charger with it. Let me tell you, to get 4-5 hours battery backup in 15 mins you need to switch off your phone. And guess what, it doesn't heat up. Doesn't have lagging issues as well. If you have a budget upto 20k, would recomend you this phone."
"PROS : speedy performance  : high quality cameras ( with slow motion  and pro mode )  : Full metal unibody ( beautifully designed  and coloured, unlike most MOTOs, it's  quite slim )  : Great battery life ( 3000 mAh )  : Above average processor  : Quick finger print scanner  : Cornering gorrila glass  : Full HD display  : Turbo ChargerCONS: Camera bulge need to be protected from  being scratched  : Hybrid sim slot don't allow to have 2 SIMs+memory card."
"looking to good, battery backup is awesome, front camera is awesome and  rear camera also, memory is too. good 64 gb it is enough, major problem is that when we use dual sim mode mode i escape my external memory card, and when we use memory card we confermise my 2 sim because at a single time i can access only 1 sim and 1 memory card at a time it to major problem but mobile is too. good"
"Pros-1. Speed-dating the speed of doing things is good. You can quickly switch to different apps without any lag.2. Camera- the dual camera works good. 360° panorama is as good as it gets. The clicked panorama moves as you move your phone, so it is pretty well!3. Display- the display is very clear. You cannot see any pixels/grains, so the pictures/video are crisp.4. Speaker- the speaker is loud enough to be heard in a room. I have seen reviews on sites which say that it isn't loud, but I see nothing like that. It's pretty loud.Cons-The only thing that troubles sometimes is the size of phone. You may find a bit of issue while touching the screen at different corners if you have small hands. Otherwise, it's good."
"Highly satisfied with the product. Excellent camera. Equalant to a basic DSLR cam effect. For people who seek basic functionality & good camera,  this is the one. Gaming speed & multi function is awesome. Worth for every penny paid"
"This is as much one can expect from a budget phone. I donot know why few people are giving one star but this is worth it. Camera in depth mode is bit laggy but that apart everything else seems to be good. For such a big phone with just 3000 mah, it easily lasts a day. So, I donot know what is the expectation of people giving 1 or 2 strar. For 15k do they expect DSLR level camera?"
"The product is good.It has good battery backup.4GB ram provides smoother performance.*Should be careful with the rear camera bump.Amazon :-""#Please don't fool customer's by showing wrong price range#""The phone 's real price is 16k but you are showing off like you are selling a 20k product"
"Android Pie just came, and I haven't yet received Oreo.I bought this one as they said it's a stock Android, but after series of security updates, it's not stock anymore. Plus, haven't received Oreo update yet, as they had promised (even those security updates are infrequent).The device is slippery, falls off easily. Mi A1 provides much better camera with less price than this one does.Pros: Turbo charging, good battery backup."
"Really great phone for this price range. The build is top notch.. similar to a flagship device. Sturdy unibody metallic build which is great to hold. The camera is sharp in daylight as well as medium light conditions. Stock Android is another highlight which makes the phone completely unbloated."
"Luvd d phone.. very smooth .. ND d pics r awsum wid diz..bt a bit on d warmmer side which I don't mind. Only problem wid d hybrid slot... Where in Sim slot 1.. jio 4g doesn't shows d volte feature bt Sim slot 2 (memory card slot) does but Dan u can't use d memory card"
"Amazon Delivery was poor, but the phone is okay.Camera is average compared to other dual camera phones. Its good in day light, but not anything outstanding. I am satisfied with the performance.Compared to Moto's other phones in this range, this one has good looks too, so if you are planning to buy a good reliable phone in this range, and is not a photography maniac, you can definitely go for this one. Battery backup is more than 24 hours for normal use."
"Mobile is Good but battery not up to the mark I Also own MIA1 it's battery is better but Moto has fast turbo charger,but one WORST thing is its headphone which is of very cheap quality also not good in terms of volume and beats and last but not the least there is lots of material saving or cost cutting charger is of low quality and wire is too short about mobile will again update after few days till now mobile is best."
"First impression is awesome. Built quality is awesome. The Camera seems good. Overall performance with apps and gaming seems flawless.The finger print sensor is  one the best in class with multiple navigation capabilities.Hoping to get a better performance for depth enabled mode in the camera (shutter lag fix and a better edge detection). But given the price range this is still good."
"One of the most reliable phones in the market. We have 3. My mom's dad and brother all use Gs5. Very happy with the performance and service."
"I'm using it for the last 7+ months. Prior to that I used a Xiomi Note 3. Recently, I started having issues with the device charging. First, even when connected to the Turbo Charger, phone was showing 12 hrs to complete charge but when you charge with the phone off it was charging completely in 1 hr 45 mins. I called up Motorola Support and they asked me to factory reset, I did and it started working fine. Second, now the Turbo Charger it self conked out. Well, I think it's not worth the additional premium you pay for this phone against its nearest competitors."
"Awesome Phone,I really Liked The Phone very mch, rear both cameras are awesome, depth pics are superb and looks like that the pics are taken from a DSLR,Front camera is also good and takes good pics.Little bit of heating problem but its normal as many phone gets heated during charging & useing.TurboPower Charger is charing the phone very quickly.All Over -The Phone Is Suberb, Awesome & And also Felling Good While Using this phone.."
"Actually I got a serious issue of charging: It took 6-7 hrs to became full charged. So I had to go to service centre, they told it's a common problem of charging wire (data cable). So they replace that and now it takes 1hr and 40 to 50 min. to be full charged.Over all it's a nice phone with some interesting features like slow motion video recording 😉, nice design, etc."
"Decent device, but plagued with problems, in addition to looking ugly and old-fashioned. Lots of WiFi issues with this device, check out the Lenovo forums. I got a device with bad WiFi reception, disconnecting every other minute. Returned it to Amazon, got a replacement device, which was even worse - disconnecting even when I was right next to the router.There seems to be something wrong with Moto's Wifi hardware/firmware, because this seems to happen a lot with other devices too (even the new Moto G6 has these complaints)."
"Compared to Moto g5 plus, this is a fresh update, It looks sleek and the full metal body is a plus.The night display feature is also good."
"The camera is not as described in ads. It's too slow to respond in normal mode also, forget bokeh effect mode. It's disappointing to see that Motorola is not interested in any update to resolve the issue. The security patch is also old, june 2017. Apart from it, everything is fine."
"Worth of money bt the front camera is not that much good back is doing decent job if u don't want to spend too much money on dual camera mob than it's a better option  ."
"This is a very good product from motorola!Face recognition and fingerprint sensor are very much fast. Processor speed with 4GB RAM is good. Rear camera 13 MP Dual & Selfie 8 MP Front Camera is awesome.Overall best buy."
"Having used this for more than a month, I think I can safely say that it was a good buy. The phone has really competitive features given its price and the option of No Cost EMI along with next day delivery made the experience great. Some pros of the phone:1) Really good battery - it just doesn't get discharged if you are in flight mode or the phone is kept on standby2) Excellent camera with depth enabled and panorama features3) Sturdy phone with quality touchscreen4) Has not shown instances of slow-down till now - decent processor5) Sensors, finger-print readers are good at the price6) Turbo-charging - although it doesn't go from 0-100 in 45 minutes, it does charge at a very good speed (about 10-90 in an hour)Cons: There are not many drawbacks I could find till now.1) Poor quality earphones provded2) Charger wire is small3) Sound is not that good on my Sennheiser earphones - it sounds much better on speaker mode than on earphone mode (yet to check this with other earphones)All in all, a great buy."
"It's a good phone I'm using it since last month . I found some minor bugs like it's flash stops working sometimes and we have to restart our phone to turn on flash .. some more issues but overall performance is good . I received a torned package with honey spreaded on the box (actually it was due to another package which was containing honey and the jar was cracked) That's the main issue ☹️☹️☹️☹️"
"built quality is fantasticram rom processor & battery is awsomecamera is exceptionally wellfeel fit & finish is top notchalways recommendedGREAT BUY : VALUE FOR MONEYonly one con is it doesn't have dedicated memory card reader"
"Day 2 of use so not tested completely. My previous phone was the Moto x style so moving to this was easy. The X Style was great while it lasted but the battery was horrible! It used to heat up too much  and drain very quickly. Hopefully will not face too many problems with this.Using multiple apps at the same time is a breeze with the 4gb ram. Photos taken even at night came out pretty good though a little washed out as I had to increase the brightness before I took them.Most reviews said the phone didn't have NFC but it does!Build quality is really good and the screen is great. I really don't see myself moving to an Amoled screen. Fingerprint sensor works like a charm! Happy with my new phone!"
"This mobile is very good. Though I got a defective piece but Amazon as always they are ready to replace. Overall I'm happy. Everything is good especially the fast charging, camera is average. Performance is superb."
"Works flawlessly. No issues. Wasn't charging at all at first, but after installing all the software updates fast charging works properly. Tends to get a little warm after about 15-20 mins of constant usage due to which the palm sweats a little and the phone gets a little slippery. But if you use a back cover then there won't be a problem. Phone is a bit on the heavier side but you get used to it in a couple of days.Overall the phone works great, doesn't hang at all. Heavy games like asphalt 8 run smoothly.Camera is good not very good though."
"In a single word, it's a masterpiece.Feels very premium...stunning look...great performance... awesome camera...perfect battery backupOne can't get better than this.... unmatchable smartphone under 15K.You will get disappointed if run behind the popular names like Samsung, Nokia or oppo, vivo, redmi etc.Just go for it...loved it.Thanks Amazon for quick delivery prior to Durgpuja😙"
"Firtly, I paid for 1 day delivery but got the phone after 3 days thanks to Amazon and their empty promises.After 7 months of use now I am putting this review:Pros-- Look and feel while using is premium.- Fast charging is awesome.- Network connectivity and internet speed is good.- Moto shortcuts are great - specially one touch navigation.Cons-- Average camera- Heating issue while charging and fast battery drainage.- Pray that you don't have to go to the service centre. I was not so luck and my screen burned without any heavy use. Had to visit them thrice and they don't have any spare phones."
"Got this product before the estimated delivery date, thanks to Amazon for fast delivery. I got this phone @9000 bucks with exchange offer. Coming to the phone it's just an awesome device. It's far better than Redmi note 5 pro if you can manage with 16:9 screen instead of 18:9 screen aspect ratio. The camera is slightly better in Redmi note 5 pro but instead of this we are getting lot more in Moto g5s plus like good speaker, more vibrant display, fast charging, good battery life, A brand, stock android experience, timely OTA updates and lot more, and the most important it won't blast.. 😂😂 what else you want??Just go for it👍"
"Great performance and Ram management. Battery backup seems okay for 1.5 days.Camera not upto the mark especially in low light. But it has many features. They continue to improve camera with updates. Camera bump at rear means additional care.I would have preferred amoled to ips display. But its not a big issue.Fingerprint unlock works really well. Best feature for me is the one touch navigation.Good phone. But fast getting outdated with the upcoming Moto G6 and also the oreo update for newer phones."
"After purchasing Moto g3 and using that phone for straight 2 years..  thought to purchase same company phone.. Moto g5s plus.. was my worst decision to do. . battery charging is a problem..phone got dead on 2nd day.. and Amazon refused to return back.. as they say phone is not working we cannot trace EMI.. I should have went for court.. but gave to service centre.. turbo charger worked for a month then it takes 3 hours for full charge..And on top of that.. amazon gave me defect piece and refused to return it back. Won't buy any electronic from Amazon again."
"Not a soo great product. Not so fast like 2ghz as company claiming as I am facing mobile getting slow while usingHeating issueCamera user interface is worstCamera is dual, but i doubt one camera is just a dummy lens as when I covered one lens with cloth there was nothing visible in screen, so I think only one camera is workingBattery back up is also not soo good. If you reacharge 100 % also maximum I am getting half day battery backup with medium usage such as playing music and checking internetTotally it's a worst experience for me"
"I have been using this phone for 1 month and I'm totally happy with the performance with the phone but I don't capture too many pics so I'm not concern about the camera but all in one phone. You can buy It but if you're a Samsung person then it's far better then Samsung. My recommendation is that you can buy this phone without hesitation but first have a look ok Redmi A1(Android One). Camara quality of that phone is comparing to this phone if you're curious about camera then that phone is also good. I'm happy with the Moto G5s plus it meets my requirements."
"Disappointed. Expected it to be an upgrade from Moto G4S plus.The back of the phone is very slippery ... your only choice is risk breaking it or get an ugly cover to make it thicker and heavier.Weight is more than G4S+Voice quality on phone call is poorer as compared to G4S plus.Camera is superior to G4S+Overall not very pleased with the performance."
"Excellent product. Configuation is very good given the budget.I have been usign this product for last 6 months.Performance is also very good. I have not faced any lag in this phone so far.You can play heavy games and it still run smooth.Plenty of space.Good battery life(last 1 day under normal use)Good camera qualityGood speakerNote: there are two sim slot, but one slot can either be used for sd card or sim card, not both"
"i have bought this mobile in September and  used it for two months finger print sensor isn't working properly and the earphones are not working properly (only single earphone is working). The mobile charges faster with turbo power charger.touch is average even if your fingers are little we it doesn't function properly.even the flash doesn't work properly (takes longer shakes to turn on  flash light). Most of the ram by default is  consumed by many inbuilt applications.audio quality is good(both in terms of voice and music). even though the mobile comes with default document reader application but it  gets stuck  when you open a document(most of the time it gets stuck or takes time to open the document). Got heated for  the first 15 days while charging and when used continuously."
"I have been using this phone for three months now. Everything about the product is good except two issues : 1. The phone gets heated too soon. Even an half hour talk heats up the phone enormously, 2. The phone is too slippery. I am sure It's gonna drop outa my hands some day.This phone does not have a to do list which is quite a handicap when you want to make some notes. Otherwise the phone is value for money."
"I am writing this review after using it for about 40 days. The mobile is very nice, no lag. Its very fast and reliable. Amazon service was very nice. Delivered one day before the expected date. Packing was acceptable, if not so great. Overall, I would recommend this mobile.Thanks."
"This phone doesn't have magnetometer. Hence it doesn't support the compass related apps like skyview, magnetic compass. Also google maps will not move as per your movement in terms of directions"
"I ordered my moto g5s plus on 8th november and received it on 11 th november .The phone starts with a stylish moto intro.and ask for a few settings.After that the phone is for YOU...Phone features a variety of special  features such as  1:A proper google assistant which recognises ur voice and is very helpful.  2:Camera with a variety of modes such as Depth mode ,which creates a highly featured camera.  3:Awesome specifications such as 4gb ram,Led flash light,fast charging,splash proof screen,gorilla screen 2.5,supports 4K,no heating issues ,stylish metallic body,and many more .  In short,I highly recommend it to u if photo shooting is ur highest priority ,Great Budget Phone ,Too much impressed by it.... Fantastic....."
"awesome product ever used ,,,earlier i was always using and also suggesting every one for samsung  only...but latter on i changed my opinion as my younger brother suggested me about moto products,in fact in moto brand i am satisfied with the moto g5s+ the brand and model is outstanding... and readers i hope that you all will aso would like to give feedback after using the brand.. ***********and again i would say that in this price range you wont get so better product."
"Looks peppy, feels premium and durable. Slippery though, have ordered also for a back cover...Camera is decent, better than the rivals at this price range...Performance till date is good, no lag or issues.Charge is at par holds for a day...Sound and display quality is good at this price...First Moto ever, good experience...Hope to hold it for longer..."
"Great:Display.Battery.Fast Charging.Stock Android customised a little by Motorola.Buttery user experience. No stutters. Great Software.Camera.Could be improved factors:USB C port instead of micro-USB could be therePhone speakers could be improved. It's loud but could be made more noise free.A G5S Plus version with Android One would have been great.Moto G6 Series is on the way solving some of these concerns.Verdict: Great phone. It won't disappoint you."
"It performs good for initial few months. Then it starts giving battery back-up problem.I approached customer care. And they suggested to use it in Safe Mode where third party apps (which were not originally there on the phone & were later downloaded like whatsapp) don;t work. Can we imagine a smart phone which troubles if u install  apps which are being used on almost every smart phones these days? What for is this MotoG5s Plus called smart phone then?"
"Bought couple of months back and dropped the phone several times. Oops! But still running like a horse. Camera is decent but not very good. Other features are good."
"Excellent. No doubt go for it. Excellent Processor speed. camera is stunning. Battery backup is good - no internet 2 days backup - using internet one day backup. very slim and grand look. many features but only thing is object focus not available. rather than this everything is ok at this price and only in branded."
"Great for the budget . Can consider mi a1Again writing after 2 months great phone although the dual camera setup could not justify itselfAgain after 1 year still not able to get Android update ......Damn what is is lenovo doing to moto lineup wish google would buy it back"
"great product. The only problem is that it gets heated during charging but that is what happens to most of the turbo phones with turbocharging.also, there is no option for native video calling which should have been there, at least that's what I think. other than these two, the phone works fine as hell."
"After using a month or soI am reviewing this product again.I have replaced the product once as I had the problem with turbo charger (The Charger known as turbo charger which charges faster than the other chargers)But it's a honest opinion it doesn't worth it.I have even used the Moto g4 plus but Moto g5s plus doesn't charge as faster as I expected if I compare this phone with Moto g4 plus.Not so satisfied with the charging thing rest the phone is good.Easy to use, no hanging issue and yeah hybrid Sim slot makes the choice bit confusing for people who wants to use dual SIM slot with the memory card as well."
"PRODUCT IS GOOD VALUE WISE IS ALSO GREAT BUT ATLAST WE NEED BATTERY BACKUP AT THE END OF THE DAY... I M DIE HEARTED FAN OF MOTO BUT I FOUND THEY ARE NOT USING GREAT QUALITY BACK UP BATTERY... IN THIS MOTO G5S PLUS MY BATTERY DAMGE WITHIN 8 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE WITH ONLY PHONE AND INTERNET. BEFORE IN MOTO S STYLE SAME PROBLEM I HAVE FACED IN THAT MODEL 1.6 MONTHS AFTER BATTERY NOT RESPONDED CORRECTLY.... I SUGGEST U NOT TO PURCHASE THIS BRAND ANYMORE IF U ARE PURCHASING THIS BRAND U CANNOT USED THE WHOLE DAY BATTERY BACKUP..... IN FUTURE NO TO MOTO...."
"Awesome phone with awesome built quality. decent camera with depth it doesn't give sharp images as compared to mi A1 or other phone.Not awesome at low light images but quite decent what u can expect from a mid range phone, front camera is awesome in low light as well with front falsh. Speaker is good Enough for a mid range phone. Phone gets heat while charging or if u use it continuously for half an hour, if u are a decent user of phone that it lasts for a day Otherwiseu have to charge it twice but i don't mind it to charge twice becoz it also have the turbo charging takes 1 hour 40min approx to charge it full from 0-100. Now its upto you"
"It's been 15 days that i am using this phone, first 10 days battery performance is okay but i have noticed from last battery reducing very quickly even phone on stand by. it' really not good :(Camera performance : while clicking picture outside in sunlight, photos are good but not up to mark. i think this happened because of now moto has owned by Lenovo :(In low light picture are okay from primary camera but in want to take selfies, it's not good.Multi tasking on this phone is really good.Games are work well on this device.Turbo charger is good. 0 - 100 % charge in 1 hr 40 min perfectly.With single speaker, sound is really good. but headphones are one of the worst i have ever used.Even speaking on call while using headphone sounds comes very low."
"HONEST REVIEWbought 2 phone on december 2017.The features are good. But both phone has heating problem.Specialy while charging. It heats so much that you don't need a water heater. And as it has 30mnt water resistants you actualy use it as water heaterAfter 2 months charger pin not connecting.And the service policy is so poor that you can not replace the charger  even after having warranty.If your phone has anykind of scratches on it then it won't come in warranty anymoreNow it is uptonyou wheter you want buy or not"
"PROS:Quick chargeMultitaskingPricePerformance64GB StorageStock AndroidDisplayBuild quality and unibody.CONSNot the best camera. But can overlook because of the price.Depth effect is a marketing stunt.In short, the PROS far outweigh the CONS. Would highly recommend."
"Phone is overall good but lacks some minute but important features-Cons--No notification light-Speaker are worst-Rear cameras are ejected outward so un comfortable to handle- hand gestures dont work all time-has no compass so can't use in vr headset and some maps features-some basic ui features like network speed and daily data usage in notification bar is missing-and few morePros--fast lag free-sleek-Good processor good gaming experience-camera quality is ok and can record in 4k-feels like stock android-battery is amazing and charge in minutes"
"Here is my review after 10 days usesThis phone is bestest phone I was ever looking for . From every side like camera , battery , performance and everything . Before buying this I was Soo confused between Moto G5S plus & MiAi but this phone made me realize that I was Soo right.Don't think guys just go for this phone"
"Iam satisfied with this phone after the 13days of usage...  iam sharing my experience here:Pros:*good camera both front and back*good design*fast charging*jio sim support*super and fast fingerprint scanner*no unwanted pre-installed apps; thanks moto*good sound quality*Good display*625 snapdragon processorCons:*confused about the battery backup. Now its backup is approx arround 1.5days.*hybrid sim(1sim+1sim or 1sim+micro sd card)*no c type usb"
"Awesome mobile camera is good... battery back and design n style looks great...That all I have for now will update this review after using it for 3 months.."
"Yeah nice device at it's price, nice camera gives good clarity pictures, smooth interface, front camera is to good, good wifi connectivity and good signal range, looking owsome, buttery smooth touch, it like moto display very muchh cause it has dark colours like sony smartphone's display overall good device for 16k..."
"It's a decent phone. I'm impressed with the charging, it is quite fast. But, since it has a metal back, it can get pretty hot if you do some heavy gpu or cpu intensive work like gaming. The bulge from the camera in the back feels a bit weird but you'll get used to it.One problem is that the fingerprint scanner works even when your phone is locked. So, if I touch the fingerprint sensor with my elbow, it will register and show error. So it's kind of annoying. I wish they activated the fingerprint sensor only when the phone is awake.Otherwise, this phone is great for the price."
"The phone is amazing. Early delivered by Amazon. Nicely packed. Light weighted phone, no lagging issues, camera is good, built quality is also good, class phone at this price. Thanks Moto & Amazon 😊"
"Its a good mobile from Motorola.Loud speakers.Premium look.Camera is little bit slow while capturing shots with depth enable mode.Good Battery backup.Smooth performance.Overall i like this mobile just go for it if you intrested to buy this mobile"
"Not happy with the service of lenevo. Charger got burnt within two days of buying the mobile. I went to the service centre to get it changed. They said we have to update the software to change the charger. All my data would be lost. If that was my mobile I would have returned the phone. That was for my father who didn't like getting it exchanged, so we have to update the software. When there is problem with charger why update the software."
"First of all buy it from Amazon for a very low price.The phone feels premium in hand because of its metal body make and is powerpacked with a 2 GHz clockspeed qualcomm chipset.The only con is that it doesn't have a compass sensor.The camera comes with the professional as well as depth mode which really helps capture good photos.Battery is 3000 mah which is a decent one.Tip-Get a good back cover as early as possible to protect the camera bump from scratches and damages.Overall,worth spending 12 k for such a device."
"Excellent Phone in this range and segment.No heating problem even when we are browsing or playing games.Camera quality is good for both rear and front.The only area I am expecting a better performance is -- Battery back-up .. its coming for a day even for a moderate users. If we use much applications which use location .. you may have to carry the charger along with you.BTW .. its a Turbo (quick) charger which is another advantage."
"It is one of the worst handsets I bought and motorlloa service has been really pathetic to say the least. Gifted this handset to my father and there was an issue with the speaker right of the bat .. sent it to service centre and they determined there is no water or physical damage and said they will get it fixed still after testing they refused to fix some.internal Ic issue as it's something that they cannot fix.. horrible service I would really ask everyone to stay away from Motorola and if I can get an escalation email that will be great"
"I m not satisfied your this product because I have many issues facing in my handset. Charger Cable is Not Working from phone purchased 2 month after, Finger Print is Not Working properly , Network issues in my handset, Some time Phone systems stopped automatically, heating Issues,  automatically calling time phone switch off  etc . I really tell you dear when I look for advertising that time I'm very happy to see Motorola G5s plus is very nice handset but I tell you that time I m very frustrated & I have very nice experience im used many Motorola phones.Please do the reply I'm waiting for your good Answer.ThankAnurag9821206243"
"For this price you CANNOT get this combination of hardware and software. There are many other phones that are cheaper with better specs like Xiaomi but they have absolute crap UI. This one has near stock Android. Something every Android user likes."
"I have used both the g5 plus and the g5s plusIn first lookThe g5s plus is just same as g5 plus apart from the build quality and the larger screen sizeThe performance is also the sameBut these time there is bloatware includedAnd the colour for the moto display is fixed to blue and that was quite disappointingThe battery is capable for a day just like g5 plusAnd the turbocharger sure helps a lotThe camera is not what i expected it needs improvments on both front and the rear .Images from the Front camera gets dark when its exposed to light which many other camera in price bracket does but it was absent on the g5 plusAnd the low light capability is horrible .While the rear camera is more sharper than g5 plus but it lacks the brightness of g5 plus and the rgb sensor only works the other one is only for depth measuring .I believe that these issues could be solved by updatesApart from the camera this I a solid product"
"A really good budget phone.*Very good speakers*Good camera*Smooth switching between appsUsing it from past 2 months. Still no lag. I hope it remains the same.If you're looking for a good phone under 16k. I think you should definitely go for this one.All the best:)"
"The phone is too good...its build quality is marvelous... Performance is very snappy and plays almost any game thrown at it... camera is also very good, takes decent pictures even in low light..the external speaker is so loud I was blown away... Call quality is decent... Battery could easily last for one day with moderate use...fast charging rocks...overall a very good phone in this price range... Must buy if you like it..."
"It's a decent phone at this price. I bought the product for 13k and it's worth it. Camera is decent, not as great as shown in the advertisements. The speed is on the slower side but you can't expect everything to be great in a phone at 13k..display is fine...looks more than decent and 64gb internal memory is good enough to store most of the data... battery lasts one full day if you don't use this phone for gaming or watching videos..touch is pretty responsive and fingerprint reader is also fine. Nothing great about the phone, but nothing bad either. A decent phone at this price..."
"I got this phone yesterday and everything is awesome, processor is very fast, sound is very loud, battery is great for one day with normal use and turbo charger charge is quite fast it charge the phone fully form 0 to 100% in 1 hour 40 min., only problem is with camera its slow but I think that can resolved with an update and now Moto also confirm the 'O' android update that's great. I really love the phone and waiting for this type of phone."
"Build and design are awesome, in terms of camera it dont satisfy my expectation , i dont know may be i expect too much?. I  was using moto g4 plus , as compare to it moto g5 s plus doesn't  beat  in terms of camera, i think g4 plus does better in front cam. Still good phone though."
"Please note its 2months im using it , and I already started facing issue with the 3.55mm jack , headphones not working in this jack at times. I have tested the headphones on all other phones it is perfectly working. Also the phone do not work in compass , they donot have the compass specific sensors. Rest all are ok,,...I would suggest you go for Mi A1 than this, but if you want radio mandate then only go for this keeping in mind my above points."
"Good phone with all around performance. However I feel, there are some issues need to be taken care.1. Notification light although available, works only in case of extremely low battery. For other use, one has to root the phone.2. Screen casting in smart TV is an issue which was pretty easy with my previous Lenovo phone.3. Hybrid sim slot. No dedicated slot for memory card."
"The camera is too bad, it is like 5 MP rather 13mp dual camera, And mobile is getting heat up too much while charging. I have contacted the technician they are it is built as per Motorola standards, I haven't thought Motorola standards will be like this especially for the camera. Those who want camera clarity don't choose this, the smartphones under 10k are giving more clarity than this. My sincere request is to not to go for this who wants to have the camera."
"This phone I bought for my wife. Look and feel is really good. Great camera. Sound quality also nice while watching movies or playing games it produces enough sound. While charging or keeping in hand for longer time it gets little heated up as it has full metal body.It feels premium."
"This is my review after using 2 weeks.bulid quality is good.camera is good.best for games.i think this is the best phone for this price.ConsSpeed of camera is not much fast.it is taking 6 seconds of time to take a picture.after a few days fingerprint is not working as same as the first day"
"I got it for 9300 so for me there is no better deal than this. I got this phone in exchange of my old motog3 which i really wanted to get rid of because of the memory space issues. Now i have a better and a 4gb/64gb phone to back up all my datas so i am very much happy and content."
"The performance and battery is very good. 13+13 mp dual camera has not impressed me. This phone supports 2 sim card or 1 sim card + 1 memory card. So you need a back cover and hybrid sim adapter to be able to use 2 sim card + 1 memory card."
"Last 10 days se use kr rha huAmazing product of MotoBy the way I like Moto this is my secondI used Moto G3 and still using.Starting me camera achha nhi tha lekin 4 update aaye aur ab achha ho gya but abhi 8.1 nhi aaya hai wait kr rha hu uskaBattery life must hai turbo charger amazingAbi 1-2 baar heat hua hai charging k samay baki koi problem nhi haiAnd Ek galti ho gyi prime day pr 12k ka hi mil rha tha lekin mene baad me order Kiya to 13k ka hi MilaLast me thanks to Amazon for before time  delivery"
"Each smartphone have it's pros and cons. Please refer below pros and cons.Pros:<Pure Android experience with moto apps features.<Universally unlocked by default<Good display<Call quality is good<Battery long last per day with normal uses and having turbo charging facility.<Performance and memory management is good.Cons<Default Video calling is missing but you can use 3rd party apps.<While charging phone is getting hot.<camera clarity and photo capture issue.<infrared and compass sensor is not available but not found any issue while using map(gps) navigation while travelling.<Still used micro USB instead of Type-c port.<Dolbey atom is missing.Overall as per price, I will recommend to buy this phone but as per your need."
"Good build qualityNice fingerprint sensor and oneway navigation buttonTurbo charging support (Great)Very decent camera performancePowerful 2GHz octa-core processor.4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage - Added advantage.3000mAh gives long lasting battery!Getting regular security updates!"
"Superb build quality...Perfect camera...Battery enough for one day usage..Good display...A fast fingerprint sensor...Nice call quality.."
"Writing this review after 16 days of my purchase.Mobile is running smoothly.. And when I compare it to its competitors I fully satisfied that I choose Moto reather than mi or honor..Camera is very good . Depth enable mode is what I love most about it .. it took a little time but it's ok..Charging is big boost to me it runs almost 20 hours with internet use ... And almost 1 and half day without it.Mobile heats up when you charge it for the first time and it also took time but after 3 4 time full charging it work great.."
"Pros.Value for money Product.Lightweight.Large screen with full HD is really nice for watching movies and videos.Turbo charger charge your phone from 0 to 100% in 1.25 hours.Very fast processing.Camera quality is best.Metal body makes you feel good.Cons.No notification light.Metal body makes device slip from your hand. I bought a cover as well to overcome this."
"Day1 - Heating problem as soon as it was plugged into charger,Day1 evening after all updates done restarting in loop. Day2,morning-It went dead after multiple attempts not powering ON. Amazon promised to send a technician to check the issue. Day 2 -Afternoon, powered ON and showing 47% battery but still restarting in loops. so took a micromax fone and put my sim card now life seems to be fine.May be a defunct product as i have been using motorla from long time never faced such issues before. Is it the quality of motorola has been compromised by Lenovo.....time to think over the same."
"I bought this phone in June 2018. At first, it was working perfectly. No issues at all, battery life was brilliant and would charge super fast. However, since yesterday, the battery is acting really weird. When I put it on charge, it starts discharging instead (tried using a different charger too). One second it shows 23%, and within less than a second it says 99%. On restarting, it goes back to 30%. It is within warranty,  but extremely shocking that within  just ONE month of buying the phone. I'm facing this problem. Expected so much more from Moto."
"The product is really good .Camera quality is very goodNo major crashes observedhardware quality is really awesome , my phone accidentally fell down from 23rd floor and unbelievably there is not a single scratch on device ,"
"The camera software cannot white balance correctly while shooting indoors or using flash. There is a significant yellow tint in the photos, especially on the skin tones. Neither the Amazon technical team or the Motorola Support Center acknowledged this issue. If you are buying the phone for good quality photographs, you will stand disappointed.Hopefully Motorola corrects this in their future software upgrades."
"Phone is awesome ....good battery backup and processor is handling the applications very well ..... camera is the only thing that made me worry about although it's not bad and for this range I think that's good but making it with the dual rear camera it should deliver some what good camera clarity although day light images are good overall I ll give 7.8 for camera and 8.7 for the phone performance, looks, battery backup."
"I am using this phone since last two months. I overall phone quality is very good. Battery quality is good enough to stand for 24 hours after standard usage. I found the phone function smoothly during multitasking and heavy gaming experience. Camera quality isn't very satisfactory but not even below standard within same category. I found  this phone worth purchasing within this price range.Sudip BhattacharyyaKolkata"
"Pathetic phone, don't go for Motorola phone. Before buying go and check on Lenovo forrum, so many problem. Poor connectivity, poor ingress protection, everybody having this phone, can check there will be dust accumulated on rear camera lens. If you ask Lenovo guys they will ask you to go to service center, where problem will be solved for that day and again after 4-5 days you can found dust on lens.. it won't if you use this phone in air conditioned places.. so don't go for it"
"All specs match up to the phone, it's amazingly fast and has good storage, battery. For 16k this is the best phone!My only worry was that it has a metal body and would heat up, but it doesn't! Only while charging, little bit, but that's working as designed, coz you're not supposed to use it while it's charging.Oh one more thing, the speaker is not that good... It's okayish, very less bass."
"Using this mobile since a week, nd I feel it's worth every ruppee spent😉. The phone feels premium in hand nd performs well without any major issues. Haven't faced any heating except a lil warmth while charging, which is normal for a metal build phone. Camera lag is a pain for quick shoots, other wise a good package😃"
"Battery last's for 2 days, camera is good, I don't  have to carry my dslr with me, this phone is all I need.I would love to see moto upgrading  battery, well everything  is good.Do buy cover because the phone is slim and yeap I dropped it on the 3rd day luckily just got a mark on a cornor and nothing  else.So dont waite and buy one cover hehe"
"Mobile phone is good.i am using it from last 8 month betrry back up is more than 24 hrs after full charge.some time it's hang but it is genral problem in all mobiles.some time mobile is hit up when it's on charging.But data cable is not good quality.i am replace data cable every 15 days after puchase mobile.i am replaced data cable more than 10 times."
"Shocked to find software problem just out of the box! Be careful of updating! I tried to- and all sorts of error messages came up. After a lot of sweat, set the mobile back to factory mode. I have lost the thrill of having a new cellphone."
"This is one of the Dumbo phone I have ever used compare to redmi note 4 and  honor 7x.Cons:-* Heating Issue- phone heats up in continue 1 hour of surfing.-Auto focus issue - Has too many issues while taking closeup shots.-Depth effect is hit or a miss, takes more than 2 seconds to process the image.-phone lags too much.-No notification light.-still using the old feature to take the screenshot i.e volume + power button. Wheras others started using 3 finger gestures.- Big bezels.-Too heavy."
"It's been almost a month since I purchased this phone. The features are awesome . Love the blue light reduction at night. The software is much upgraded fast and responsive. With 64 gb forget about memory storage issues. The camera is ok , nothing extraordinary but good enough for your normal clicks. The sound output through blue tooth is awesome much better than other Moto phones. The metallic body and phones slim deaign is fantastic.  in the price range it's a great phone to own."
"I got this mobile yesterday, I am very much satisfied with the features it has for the price I paid. Paid from Amazon pay and got 500 RS cashback too. Feels nice to have this in hand. Light weight. Pic quality is very good in both front and rear camera But that depth effect is fake. It does not produce the booke effect. Apart from this This phone is a masterpiece. Probably the best phone in this price segment."
"The mobile get heated while chargingNetwork issue occurreWe can't use call recorder in this mobileOnly turbo charging is goodCamera not so good.  Ohk ohkPerformance is goodBattery life is goodSound is good ear phones very low quality"
"This is a pretty cool mobile specs are amazing i am posting this review after 25 days of purchase and i didn't face any lag or something worth every penny ;) i played almost every heavy games  but this phone never disappoints"
"Phone is good, Sound quality is awesome , feature is nice, camera quality is better  but only one sim having 4 g and another having 3 g , when I returned my phone cause of display issue again I got scratch cell phone from Amazon. I am requesting Amazon whenever return initiate please make sure that you are giving nice and new things to customer instead of used .I noticed one more thing which is my back side cover of cell phone was rubbed."
"Really it's wasting of money. I am now having so many problems during last month, where it is only 3 months of it's purchasing .  From the first day the handset having charging related problem, where it going too too much hot during charging . Now from few days the scroll bar of the mobile is not working properly, it's just stop working then if I power off the mobile & then on the power , it start work for next some hours . Again to say there are very much of network problem with this handset. The speed of Internet totally gone down with this handset. I am really fade up with this device."
"The Device is not even a year old but started showing Issues with Battery. for the last 6 months, the Phone was flawless.i really loved it during this period but all of a sudden the battery is not up to the mark. I am a decent user of the phone and never used adapter other than the MotoG supplied one. haven't done Overnight Charging. but still, it's not great to see the Phone Slowing down even less than a year. 3 star is for the Awesome performance that it gave me for last 6 months. its really saddening to see it going down"
"Looks : is goodCamera : ok, although it has 13 Mp dual camera but pictures aren't that great.Metal body: pro, it looks good and con, body gets heated easily.Turbo charger: it charges fast 0 to 100 within 1.30hrs.Battery: it drains very fast.The above issues are still manageable but the think which is forcing me to give 2 star rating is the slowness of the phone, it gets hangs every now and then , you wouldn't feel it has 4gb ram there are times I using an app and the app shuts automatically."
"I have had no issues with this phone, the phone does heat during charging but almost every phone with quick charging feature has that problem.No lags, the camera is average but you get what you pay for. Only thing that should be kept in mind is that there is no tempered glass available in the market which fits the phone perfectly, they are all small in size.Also the phone looks premium, especially the back."
"This is one of the solid phone I seen in market.Build quality is really so good.Camera is okok but night photos handle very well.Very big screen.Full day battery.Awesome screen.No lag after installing 123 apps and open all apps at a time.Amazing game play experience.Sound is too loud.Mic is little bit problem.Expected more from camera side."
"Not very happy with the user interface - compare to the LENOVO Vibe used immediately before this one. Couldnt locate an audio recording facility - trying to find a quality reliable one from Play store. - Not very comfortable . Couldnt recommend this one. Sorry."
"Pros:-Superb display-Smooth UI (Stock Android experience)-Awesome built quality-Great performanceCons:-Sluggish camera (especially depth mode)**But, thanks to new update in Moto camera 2  app. Now, it works like a charm.Conclusion:If you want something which tick all the right boxes...Go for it...."
"Hi..the phoneis fine but the charger is making quite a loud hissing sort of sound while charging. Please help it feels pretty unsafe charging it anywhere around you. I used a Moto phone with turbo charger earlier but had no sound. Please help."
"Issues I faced...(i) hotspot.. it automatically gets disconnected from others devices after few minutes ..n I have checked all the settings too..btttt this problem occurs.(ii) charging of this phn is not upto the mark.. drains lots of charging ..!!Otherwise the Device is no doubt a good choice.. excellent camera.. memory .. nd no hanging problem till now as my device is having a huge amount of files..Nd best part❤️mese ye phn iitttiiii baar .. itte bure bure dhng se girra hua h pr 1 b scratch ya kuch khraab ni hua.."
"Never ever buy moto product. I was a big fan of moto mobiles. But after the usage of 8months of my moto g5s plus, my 100% battery lasts only for 4-5hrs . When met moto a customer service centre,they just clearly mentioned, your battery got destroyed and you needed to replace it with a new one which would cost 2190rs as according to them battery did not come under their warranty. So tell me please,,why should I buy moto product if a phone costs 16k can not give a battery life of at least 1year??(I review is 100% true who has become a victim of moto product)"
"Purchased with good expectations. It was good for first 3 months. Then charging problem noticed. It used to take more than half day to change fully.From moto service desk, I got it resolved. OS reinstalled. However, it's not as good (power standby) as it was initially.Later noticed, the mobile was lagging a lot. Not up to the expectations."
"Lit Phone !!!!!!!!!Very smooth UI and never freezes or hangsAwesome battery lifeFront camera is good in light not in low light never comparable to iPhoneBack camera is ok for photos great for videosGood ram managementTurbo charge is epicAnd all the gestures are good"
"Hi, I was satisfied with the product what I have received initially, just two weeks after the usage the charger what I have received with mobile is not working properly. It is taking hours to charge up to 50% of battery. It will be very helpful if you take this concern to the respective division and will be very helpful if you provide a new charger.  Otherwise am happy with the delivery and support from Amazon."
"Good phone but not gr8. The OS is slightly bulky and shortcuts are not there for switching from dialer to messaging. Over that you can only block spam nos one at a time . I believe Samsung devices let you do these things much easier"
"Okay Ok kinda phone been using it for over a month now. It lacks some great features.Cons:1- No magnetometer hence its difficult to find your way through Google maps also no compass.2- the depth mode not so good.3- Features like schedule on/off missing.4- No IR blaster hence cannot be used as a remote control for TV, AC etc.5- security updates not garunteed.6- Till now no Android Oreo Update. And more are there to be considered. If these doesn't matter to you then go for this phone."
"Delivery was quick enough. Amazing phone with such pocket friendly price.  Wonderful feel,cool hold, amazing quality, superb fingerprint and navigation and features blah blah but I still returned it. Why? Because mic isn't compatible with snapchat or Instagram. Otherwise,mic has no issues. If you don't use snapchat or Instagram for vlogging, this phone is for you!"
"I am very satisfied with this gadget.In 16k range it is the best product with stock android experience.Design is marvelous.No heating issue.Battery backup is excellent.No lagging very smooth to operate and very fast with multi tasking software usage.Camera is good i think it will better after next update.But overall camera is good and excellent color production.Don't hesitate buy this MOTO."
"Hey Gus this Moto g5s plus is really amazing phone. I bought it @Rs 12,999 at Amazon. I love it's charging. It charges to 10-95 in 1.5 hrs only and after normal usage of phone the battery can go up to 1 day.Build Quality of Moto g5s plus is very good. You get metal back with chrome finish.It's quite heavy than other phone. Weight balance is not upto the mark.Also sound Volume is not that satisfactory. You can buy this device @12000 at sale on Amazon"
"I used moto g3 before moto g5s plus , it was far better.Plz find the below issues which I faced in one week span.> Touch is not working properly> Wt's up getting hang very frequently>If you try to delete multiple chat conversations at a time in wt's up.. it will get hang> Live cricket match was not ran through hot star>Getting acceleration decoding error, while navigating between apps continuously>Video is not getting resume if we stop in between>Dual camera is not up to the mark..I can say Moto g3 is far better with single camera>JIO sim was not detected for days.. later worked> Battery was also not up to the markI bought with lot of hopes on Moto.. finally ended up with wasting of money..:("
"I'm using this phone for now over a month.. I placed it's order on 30th August. I was hyped about the phone.. and man it is worth the hype! Excellent performance. I mean I'm a very hard user.. I do 1-2 hours gaming on an average.. watch videos like series 2-3 episodes.. social networking.. listening to music.. this beast is just doing fine! Great phone for the young generation.. specially both the cameras, the design! Wow. Nothing else to say, if you want to buy this phone you can definitely go for it.. oh and btw, some myth busters - 1. This phone has a LED notification light which is disabled initially..  and 2. It supports jio VOLTE, just the symbol is different.Happy with the product! ✌️"
"Very good - I am getting most of the features what ever I need- nice handset with in this rangeCamera quality is aswomeSensors are working very wellTurbo charger is working properly...but on first day of charging I faced heating effect but now it's working properly"
"Since 3 months i am using this mobile motog5 s plus Lunar Gray Colour and features like Camera is good and Battery life also very good but I am disappointed with running very slow comparing with other phones like oppo and vivo and Mi i don't no why it is working like this when I used to open chrome or something related to online it's working very slow even share it also and more disadvantage is adds continuesly open whichever application opens then immediately adds will visible i am irritating on this"
"The charger stopped working last week. I went to the Motorola service centre with the charger for replacement, but they need the phone, cable and charger all to be brought together. Should have been simple to check the charger with any other phone and cable. I guess they just want to avoid any action under warranty since it will cost quite a bit to go to the service center specifically for this and the customer might probably not visit the neighbourhood for the next six months on other work.Poor service Motorola."
"Amazing phone. Love it's slow motion capture.Many feature, still exploring.Please ensure to block apps running in background which consume data. Battery stay put when in WiFi, but drains when connected to4G. Looks like, the modem is not conserving the battery. You could also blame the operator, who are still not clear on power conservation of device."
"Superb phone!Exchange with red mi note 3(Missing miui😓)Got nice exchange value.Pros1. Camera quality is awesome2. Display quality better than mi phones3. Sound quality is also good (no irritation)4. No lagging (smooth performance )5. Nice built qualityCons1. Ir blaster is missing (i was used to of this feature)2. Battery capacity is 3000 mah (i m normal user it lasts whole day for me also turbo power charge fastly)"
"I am die hard fan of Motorola's phone. Motorola never disappointed me... All the phone I purchased is good. The phone is perfect, light weight, awesome camera, picture and sound quality and the best thing is previous Moto mobile use to have heating issue whereas there is no such issue with this device... Love u Moto.."
"Best phone loved it!I upgraded from g4 plus, much better. Loved the design.Used the g4 for exactly 2 yr then this g5s plus. No regret.. with using for over a week love the phone.No heating issues. Yes there is a little heating while you charge, as it's turbo charger it's expected. Other than that No issues of such.Battery would last for over a day with moderate use. If u r a heavy user/ gamer then this is not last for a day.Camera is good the depth effect is not that nicely calibrated, front camera awesome with flash.Love it. Go for it if it's ur budget"
"Nice display, good build.Enough ROM as well as RAM.Fast processor.Adequate cameras.It would have been better if fingerprint scanner was placed on the back like other Lenovo devices."
"Wat a phone yar.....In this range it is highly recommended.Pics by Moto g5s Plus... Really awesome"
"Overall  a good phone with one day battery backup and good camera performance and multitasking.Only drawback is the android update. If you are someone who wants a pure stock android experience with regular updates the don't go for it.The software experience is smooth but Lenovo, i.e. the parent company of Motorola is not rolling out major android updates on the phones due to which it is lacking behind in the software experience as compared to other phones. Therefore, if you are someone who's not bothered by the new android updates then you can go for it!"
"This was the first time I brought something other than Nokia/ Samsung, and I am satisfied. This is for my father who has recently stared using smartphone and was able to use this without much help from my part. It charges fast. Look which nice and not too heavy on pocket. Happy Customer."
"Nice budget phone with all the areas covered, well almost.Pros:Performance is decent with almost no lag during daily usage.Battery lasts for a day with extensive usage.Build quality is good and so is the call quality.Stock android experience is good to have.Cons:Except for a few sensors that are not so important in daily use, camera/image processing could be better(some updates are already rolled out for camera app and image processing).Haven't got security patch upgrade for this phone(Motorola committed a lot about rolling upgrades in time).Overall a good product in price segement.Is it recommend: Definitely yes, for someone looking for overall performance package within budget."
"The Phone is mind blowing guys...Im love it , the camera is superb and better then Mi A1 , the phone has great features and it has a fast great turbo charger that will charge your phone full in just 10 to 20 minutes and the potrait mode is much means much better then Mi A1 and it has metallic body and a nice holding hands experience the box contains the handset, A great earphones , an 3000 mAh turbo charger an usb cable and the menu guides its just a cool phone and im writting this review just after 20 minutes because it is too cool and great phone . Dont think now about any other phone just Buy it!"
"Performance wise phone is good. Quick response with touch, multi tasking n all BUT the major major issue with this phone is HEATING. Got the phone replaced twice and finally returned it due to this issue. It boils like anything when you charge and sometimes when you are using it for a longer time. Temperature rises upto 40 degrees. This could have been a good phone if this charging gets fixed.Also the camera quality is not that good comparing to another phones available in this price tag. Double camera didn't do the trick for MotoG5 S. Their previous version has good camera performance rather.So before going for this look for other available options."
"Thanks you amazon to deliver such a fantastic Phone, But please improve your delivery services.My review after using five days of this product:Moto G5s Plus 4GB & 64GB is good looking Phone, good camera quality, Fast charging with turbo charger provided by Moto, 3000 amah battery backup is good enough for full day over all it is best phone in the market in this price range.Thanks & RegardsMahboob Alam"
"The device is just awesome. Using it for last 3 months and didn't face any problem. The only problem I have with the device is that it lacks magnetometer (compass) due to which navigation is really difficult especially while walking."
"If u r looking for Budget phone go for this it's good looking and processor, RAM and storage is more dn enough it has a hybrid slot for 2nd sim or memory card BEST thing about this phone is it has a dual camera 13+13 and 8 mp front with flash . Flash is not good enough for low light photo but it is ok ok quality interface is also good n easy to use for new user ANOTHER good thing is it has turbo charging it's way more fast than fast charging . I plugged in the charger with 20% battery and after 25 mins it was charged to 89% n I was going out which really cheered me up . There's one con also while charging the phone is heated more than any other standard phone and it has a heating problem while high end or on9 gaming. Rest everything is perfect hope I have given all details one should know before buying this phone😇✌️"
"Like this phoneI think it lacks the full display feature that other phones offer in this price range but otherwise it is quite a superior phone especially the 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage and also expandable memory upto 256GB."
"- You have very conscious whenever you are holding your phone without back cover. It is too smooth so it makes easy for slip.- Batter will last for a day for sure.- Processing speed an all is good.- For Cast option it requires to purchase Chrome Cast device.- It can be consider if you are a ""moto"" lover else can go for better option in this price range."
"One of the best phone in the mid budget range. If any one compare between moto g5splus and mi A1 then I would prefer Moto .Coz of its branding and service quality and specially it's unique moto features.Why anybody will compromise this one only because of ₹1000 extra bucks from the price of Mi A1,?"
"Good. Really good... Thank you amazon"
"After 2 month use,I think you all know the positive let me tell the negative part1, duel camera is just a waste one, its work only in depth mode and that mode is not working properly.2, its not a gorilla glass, in my phone simple got scratch3, finger print scanner is also not a scratch resistant4, worst part is camera hump first its got scratch after some days its broken5, 15 minute charging is a lie approximate 1 hours for full charge6, for rough use don't buy this phoneIf you keep this phone in hand every time its kind of good phone.! Just think is 16000nt phone.! You definitely get good phone for this price.!"
"It's been a month I am using the phone. Recently got a temper glass and phone cover. The product is really good. I use it for everyday usage and official purpose. Long lasting battery (maybe it's new) however it's turbo charger is good to charge 100% within an hour. I already had use Moto G4+ hence was keen to buy this too. Good camera quality."
"Using this phone for quite some time now (3 months) ... Phone is OK but only problem i am seeing it gets restart automatically  in some days or weeks... Batter backup is good , Camera is decent , touch is smooth , looks good. So in this price range i'll say its very good to buy.phone is getting restarted by its own after using around 3-4 months... not good"
"i purchased it with lot of interest and enthusiasm, but for my astonishment its camera is very bad. no clarity. even though its dual flash. waste waste waste. but moto g4plus is good. i used it previously . based on the same experience i purchased it. but total disappointment."
"Amazon refused to take it back...also Motorola guys refused to take it back...Hotspot not working from 1st day of purchase...worst service ever by MotorolaSERVICE CENTRE  guys in Chandigarh made false promises..they wasted my 10 days and still could not solve the problem. There is no heirarchy escalation for Motorola device defects .I asked them to provide their seniors contact numbers or emails they refusedBluetooth gets activated on its own.And now 4 months later charger is not working.Will never buy Moto in future"
"Perfect phone with superb specifications. Awesome delivery by Amazon . Ordered on 21st and got on next day. Attractive sale price . Must buy. Superb phone with awesome Amazon service and also unbeatable price. 3000/ lower than Flipkart."
"Amazing performance. Stock android is great. Moto gestures are awesome. Night display is great(blue light filter). The offscreen notifications are great. In-hand feel is premium.Let's come to cons quickly.1. Depth camera mode not that great. Seriously. The 2 layers are not well separately. Lots of software upgrades required.2. The colour of metal around the screen goes off due to normal wear. A case and a tempered glass is required which I certainly hate to apply.3. The camera bump has huge perimeter. It annoys you sometimes.4. Glitches while using gestures on the single home button.5. Prone to fingerprints which annoys in daylight."
"its an wonderful product at the price range, the only cons i found in this mobile is the camera options should have been a little more higher than other mobile. lot of modes are missing in the camera. if it was there it would have made it much wonderful."
"If you are having Jio Volte problem READ THIS. The phone is excellent at Rs 12999 with 64Gb memory. For jio it might not get volte settings automatically for old sims, so just get a new jio sim for your same nunber from jio store and that might help with your Volte issue. I faced the same issue for two days and even thought of returning the product, but thankfully it got sorted out. Everything else in the phone is just fab for this price."
"Moto G5S plus is good so far..1.Fingerprint sensor & timing is so good..2.Battery backup : For Light usage - More than 2 days.. Mid user - 1 to 1.5 days.. Heavy users - leads than one day..3. Charging is too Quick..4.Camera is ok for beginners, but not for professional & camera enthusiastic's..5.Accessories : As it's an Special Edition, accessories aren't available as much.."
"Not that secure. Sometimes it will ask for security code/ fingerprints.. at other times it won't..Very slow response especially when you try to make a call.. good battery and other features. User interface not that convenient."
"1st of all thanks to amazon by it's delivery,I got my phone before delivery date,coming to phone as I m a previous Moto user I always recommend 4 Motorola sets ,phone design is superb it's not feeling that much heavier as compared to other 5.5inch phones n performance is awesome with Snapdragon processor, phone is completely lag free in heavy & high graphic games so u can njoy,Prons- turbo charger,good camera ,superb display,good sound quality in external,super fingerprint sensor,front flash....Cons-Battery could be improved, camera performance in depth mode is taking time to click, hope it will fix in coming Future....Overall phone s good in my opinion go for it who wants a good phone in this price range..."
"Phone is good. Performance of phone is also good. But while charging phone gets too hot but it also comes to normal after some time."
"Review for the phone can be found else where as it is generic. this is about the product and delivery in amazon. The product was delivered on time and works well. No issues found with the device"
"It's a been a month I have been using Moto g5splus. If you have already used Moto g4 plus I would say you would not find much difference between both the phones. Camera clarity is good but I am not sure if it justifies clarity for 26 mp. UI is almost same of usual Moto phones but this one have pre installed apps with latest Android system. Front camera comes with a flash and beautification mode which is the most distinguished feature in the budget they are offering this phone. 4gb ram and 64gb rom gives you decent performance. You get full HD screen which is again rare in this budget. All in all it is good phone."
"Pro:.excellent performance.superb baterry charging.easy to use.mind-blowing sound qualityCons:.poor quality of headphone(worst).In the back side, camera level should not be higher than the phone level.if the phone drops on the floor, the camera will get affected first.(design fault)"
"Excellent product in the 16K price range product! Don't go for any other Chinese brands, MOTO has it's own incomparable benefits. Highly recommended! Undoubtedly, the phone's battery drains faster and it hardly survives a day while fully operational. However, this doesn't mean the phone isn't worthy, it is... if your budget is upto 20K, go for this phone............"
"Iam writing this review after using this phone for about 2 weeks now , everything seems fine the images come out really well taken with its camera the only draw back is its battery and everything else is fine and you need to make sure to buy a case for this phone at the same of time buying this phone"
"The mobile heats up when plugged to 'TurboCharger'. Considering that it takes less than one hour to charge completely, the heat issue can be a minor issue.The fingerprint sensor is good. Both front and rear cameras are good, actually more than what I expected. Battery lasts for more than a day.The phone is slippery without a back cover.Overall a very good phone at that price range."
"I bought a new Moto G5s plus from amazon in the month of November, it was working fine for one month but all of  a sudden its battery was behaving abnormally weird, during charging my device rather than increasing,  it is decreasing. The three stars r only for performance and camera but batteries provided in ""moto g5s plus are faulty""."
"With the exchange offer, I bought this phone for ₹12500. It's an amazing buy at that price. Features are brilliant, it's light weight, battery life is good, cameras are superb and it's a very good looking phone. Overall I'm very satisfied."
"Got this phone from amazon few days back. Checked everything and couldn't find any issue with the product.PROS:1. Best product for the price. Much better than MotoG5 or G5s or G5s plus.2. Good delivery. Satisfied with the packing.3. Works like charm.4. Has Android 7 and works fine with a Jio sim.CONS:1. Camera panel is protruding out and needs a back cover to prevent scratches.2. Camera is good but the UI of the camera app is not that great.Conclusion:Go for it if it falls in your budget."
"I have been using this phone for almost 1 month and this is one of the best womens in this budget and it is better than me a while and I love the camera performance also and also the stock Android experience is excellent the phone is very good at gaming experience is also it does not hang or lag and video quality is also great 1080 p it is Lovely using this phone if you are confused between this and MI A1 I would suggest you go for Moto G 5S plus only the Touchpad and other things are also great front flash fingerprint just loved it"
"I love this phone. Battery is good. Even for heavy usage it comes until evening. I am loving it.Battery was a major requirement when I got this phone."
"I am using this product from last one month. It is really awesome. Good price smartphone with good quality camera(both), battery gets charged so fast. I am happy with this purchase.Fast delivery with good packaging."
"Best phone.... I just don't like this device is made by lenevo..... I have a bad experience with lenevo.....But, lenevo maintain the MOTO brand, that's awesome..."
"The phone itself is nice infact the best in this price segment, but there are few problems which are ass follows:1. the editing features like curves should be made availabe.2. the slow motion videos lack lightning.3. camera application is not having all the settings .instead of these, the phone is best one, i love the phone and i am happy that i bought this.MOTOROLA, THANKU SO MUCH"
"I am not satisfied with this product at all.. nothing fascinating in this item.. after 6 month i am facing battery problems.. charging issues. Charger issue, screen os also.. not like wat i expected.. heating is always an issue.. now i am scared to use it for net surfing also.. as the battery may drain at any time.. there is a crack over the back camera also. Camera also is not upto the mark.. could have been better.. overallNot at all a good product to put your valuable money in it.."
"Product is up to the mark, but while charging their is a frequent change in temperature. Heating issue. Looking for resolution.a"
"This is an awesome phone for the price.I didnt find the dual camera setup good at the time of purchase, after a day or two i got an update for moto camera which significantly improved its performance."
"Sim slot one was not working in first day. So I had decided to replace my phone. But after one day Sim slot one is working fine. I am still checking 2-3 days and hope everything is working fine. I love this mobile because my 2 friends suggest me and they are happy with this handset."
"The worst service for the phone from Motorola... From the initial months of purchase there is lot of problem with phone every time they forced me to visit service center for resolution.They made me visit more than 15times still getting problems wid phone and they are not ready to exchange it.Very poor build quality."
"Switched from Moto G3 to this letest moto g-series. Durability of g3 made me go for another moto g series. Look is premium, camera is awesome, specially Depth option. Grip is slippery, a back cover is must for a good grip. battery back is satisfactory annd lasts upto 24. Hours with medium to heavy usage. Lack of compass is a minus. Gps is ok."
"Not at all up to the expectations. The phone has serious design flaw. The protruding camera is a real pain. You have to be very careful while placing the phone anywhere.3 weeks of usage:Battery is drainingDust getting inside the sealed packed camera lense, no idea howI have already been to service center twice for charging related issuesNOT WORTH 13-14k range[UPDATE]Rear Camera quality keeps deteriorating"
"I needed a cheap phone while waiting for the Pixel 2 and picked up this one. I'm blown away by how fast it is! Launches and navigates apps extremely fast and does app switching and multitasking really well. The fingerprint scanner is noticably better than the one on my old OnePlus 3 and the front facing flash is a neat addition for selfies. The UI is very close to stock Android and the bloatware that came with it was easily removed or disabled. It's missing a notification LED and the camera isn't great in low-light situations but that's forgiveable in my opinion at this price point. The aluminium body also has a nice premium feel to it and it charges pretty fast with the included TurboPower charger. This phone is definitely exceeding my expectations"
"It have hybrid sim slot you can use 2sim or 1 sim and sd card.After 4 Month of uses I'll not prefer this phone becoz of it started hanging and it turn to slow even after reset of factory settings, and the worse thing is that it have battery draining problem and it's power saving mode is totally useless. Battery performance same as without power saving mode battery will drain same."
"Great phoneAnd Amazon is always best in quick delivery and product quality.Dual camera works best in landscape and depth modeGaming is awesome to experienceBattery is quite good compared to all the phones I have handled or seenOverall highly recommended for now since there are no good phones in market"
"Everything is great but without an operational manual I am not able to use it. I am a senior citizen I need a hard copy of the manual to make at least an optimum use of it. I will appreciate if you can arrange one for me. Right now I keep on asking some young people to help me. I find them helpful but are not very definite what they tell me. They have learnt by trial and error. That is not correct. I must know what are the facilities available in the phone I have bought not for show but use."
"Only those Apps which are essential to operate the phone should be uninstallable. Choice of all other apps should be left to the user. Perhaps a list of recommended apps with links would be great. I don't need apps like LinkedIn, slides etc which I cannot uninstall."
"Have been using this from a month now and found this device extremely good. Only cons is weight previously using one plus, its weight and compactness was much better than this. Other than this all features are good, camera is much better with professional mode......loving this handset"
"3 stars for some of the issues.1.Proximity sensor is poor, need to hold your phone very near to your  ears and face Literally touching.2. All sim cards Network suddenly disappeares and can't not be searched again from cellular network because it gets disabled from that menu  when no sim card found comes. You have to restart phone every time you lost the network.3. Back camera is not much good in the low light or in the evening/ night, pictures are not clear at all,  HDR is poor, My Nexus 5 HDR beats this phones HDR anytime4. Only positive thing is battery and processor."
"This phone is a beast!I drove in rain many times with this phone attached to my bike gps mount.Its water resistant.Takes good photos.performs well.charges really fast.very good phone for video capturing.I installed some bad app which was draining its battery fast.Took to service center.Brilliant service.Phone became like it is day 1 of purchase.nice phone!"
"A great phone by Moto......the best currently in this price rangeCamera,Gaming,Display etc are perfectly good for normal to heavy use.Only con is the battery which is a little less but turbo charging compensates for it.Overall it is the best buy currently....GO FOR IT"
"The phone battery is draining when I am charging with Motorola's official charger. Once I have charged my phone when it is having 21% battery after some time it switched off automatically and when I restarted my phone it showed me 59% charge. So please help me to solve this issue. And please let me know where is the problem either in my phone or in my charger."
"Much disappointed over bellow average camera quality. Within 3 days dust inserted in camera lenses.Apart from 2 cons.. great feelings.This is the 3rd Moto g5s plus I bought just because of great Built quality other than camera department."
"The product received by me is exactly as shown in the descriptions. A very good product. The only concern is that the absolute dearth of Motorola Service Centres in Kolkata. I have been a Moto customer since 4 years and find that absence of adequate service centre is the only reason why people will think twice before going for Moto products (reason for my giving 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, the Moto products are real cool stuff. As for Moto G5s, I love the set."
"Good mobile at current price.. performance is excellent and friendly operations. I am enjoying Moto brand mobile for the past 3 years.Of late this model has developed battery problem after use of six months. Battery is discharging very fast and not recharging  on switch on position even on turbo charger. I am charging the mobile on switch off position. Battery heating problem still continues."
"now I have been using this phone for a while and I really like this phone the RAM management is very good and the body in build quality is very good I would suggest people to go for this phone awesome phone great camera performance both front and back and the depth enable mode really does a nice job with its artificial Blur just need some improvement which can be fixed with the software update 👍"
"Camera is the main feacher of the phone...But for me it is the weakest part....let me explain...Due to camera position means the bump it is high chance to get damaged...also when you are trying take picture in depth mode it is taking almost 5 secs....Also battery should be a little more at least...If you can accept this 3 points then rest is excellent...should have 4 stars...."
"Purchased on 14th Feb 2018. Main issue was with battery, so called turbo charget. During charging it is showing as 7 hours left till full charge. Turbo charging did not work at all starting from day one of purchase. Even though connected to AC power it is showing as USB charging. Contacted customer technical team thro Amazon app who connected my phone to their server and tested and agreed with the issue and replaced with a new piece on 21.2.2018. I am noticing the same problem with the new piece. Still l am checking ."
"Pure Android.Clean UI.Nice screen size, 5.2"".Good battery backup.Superb performance. Thanks to Snapdragon 625.Very good front Camera. An Ok ok rear camera. Daylight shots are amazing. Good details. Night photos doesn't capture all the details but it's not bad either. You can count on me.What else you need.(I'm using from the last 6 months)."
"Starting phone works nicely but slowly slowly, the battery doesn't work nicely as it shall works, and sound system also creates problems and phone gets hanged as well and automatically it gets switched off/on some times, . It's not even 1year of phone, but already problem have started with this phone"
"To review about this phoneThe storage is good also u have two slots for sim and memory card, u can exchange with another sim if u don't have a memory cardPicture clarity is not so goodAlso battery drains out easily, my charger isn't working also after 2 monthsSound quality is good so farAlso phone gets easily damagedIt's very slippery and my phone also have many cracks like just bcz it fell down from chairOh God I just want my phone to get exchanged"
"Got it in amazon great indian sale. its a handy, touch is good and huge storage to install more apps.Cons: I feel lagging once in a while even though my usage is moderate. And camera quality could be improved, of course in this price range it is ok.overally i satisfied with moto g5s +."
"Hi guys, I'm giving this review after usage of 6 months.* Fast Charing is not happening.* Mobile getting switchoff with out any action.* Too much heating if you are not using the  mobile also.*  Even if you put charging also after one hour it  was getting charge only 10%*  Even 4gb ram is waste because mobile is  getting stuck for every action.In my point of you please don't buy this mobile. First 3-4 months it works properly but after that performance is nothing. Not a worth of money."
"After using 1 month, I am going to review it.Pros.1.turbo charging impressive2  battery is good3. Processing is also good.Cons.1.no notification light2.no comlass censor u can't download compass .if you lost in jungle ur Moto can't help.4. Depth mode is not impressive5.back camera is out so u need special care for it.6. It u want finger sensor with ur WhatsApp or any other u need to download third party app."
"This is a best product by Lenovo Motorola. I used this mobile almost one month and feeling good for usage. Metal unibody design makes the feel like premium phone. It is a excellent product in under Rs.20,000/- segment. I like the camera features and clarity. There are lot more features in this phone. Worth for money."
"Very good smart phone in this price range ..I have been using Moto phone from last 3 years .My 1st Moto phone was Moto g 3 ,that was also nice and very durable phone.This is my 2nd Moto experience...Always Moto rocks...very good camera ..I really likes Moto gestures...Any one likes it very much...Only one issue is that Moto still not giving Oreo update..Now a days all phone comes with Oreo os .I am still waiting..."
"1) Best budget phone with good specifications.2) Good camera performance. Photos have good amount of details. best phone in budget segment for low light photography.3) Steardy phone love that metallic unibody design.4) This phone supports high end graphics  games.5) Battery lasts easily for a full day with 4G And  last thanks to the turbo power charger."
"Bettery bekar h Baki to average phone h but charger 2 hi din m khrab ho gya or service center gya to vo Amazon ka bill valid ni mante fir mne Amazon valo ko bola ki exchange k liye to ye log pickup to 12 hr m krne k liye ready but delivery m inhe one week chahiye it din aaj ki date m without​ mobile survive krna ye hm sab ko pta h kitna mushkil h all most sab Kam khtm ho jate h so is pr Amazon valo ko kuch krna chahiye it's a big problem for customers thank you"
"Good phone and great experience with it. The build quality of the phone is good and smooth user interface was also good. The phone also has good battery life and charges quickly with bundled charger. The camera alone might be even more great with depth effect. The Moto action is also great."
"This review is after the usage of almost 10 months..I have not encountered a single issue with this handset..Picture quality at its best..Sound quality is smooth..Battery lasts a day (after turning on battery saver)Gorilla glass makes the touch experience smoothest..Real fast charging modewith my opinion.. Go for it 👍"
"I have been using this phone for 4 months.Very satisfied with the phone. Excellent battery backup. Quality of speaker is very good. Front camera is superb. Rear camera is also very nice. But quite disappointed with depth enable mode because it takes few seconds to capture pic. And in low light camera is not up to the mark. No lagging, no heating problem till now."
"Good phone at this price range. (I am writing this review after using it for 3 months and I know I am late :p )Pros1. Fast charging2. Memory managementConsCamera is okay kind. My expectation was little high because of dual rear camera feature.Thanks Amazon for swift delivery.Happy customer here:)"
"It's more than what I expected. As the display size is really big. Big in width, den MI phones .5.5 inch display is stunning. The sensors are very perfect , on time. Speed ,camera ,performance is great. Battery life is great, and then u have the saviour turbo charger which is so fast. The looks are extremely premium and a sexy design. I am really happy with my investment in Moto. Again - it's a damn beautiful device. 😍"
"I had received the phone with very visible scratches and damage near the bottom part of the phone near the speakers. I am enjoying the experience of using the phone but I am disappointed that I received a used/damaged phone. Even during replacement Amazon customer care messed up the address meaning I could not get a hand to hand replacement for the device."
"I bought this mobile 16000/-,I like this mobile and camera performance,4k video recording is so nice...4gb ram is best performance.internal storage space only 50.4,But cost is too high... Battery backup is average, snapdragon processor is k.totally mobile is k.no lagging,no struck, delivery is good.totally best buy.."
"Hello,The Moto Phone is just Great my dad loves it. and so i bought it thinking of i wud b fine while i use it,But as i am an Ios user, i cant get used to it.so here i wud like to sell it again, who even wish to buy this phone less then the original price, feel free to contact me (9909423707), its just 1 day old used and tuffen glass is on the screen and the all accessories are there."
"Great phone!Battery lasts for the whole day on internet usage (4g) and music. Other specs are similar to reviews posted by other users.Suggestion: Thumbs up if you are also waiting for a black (Matt/ glossy) phone with the Moto logo lit with white LED when you attend calls/ get notifications."
"got delivery as per scheduled time and phone worked right out of the box. am loving the fingerprint sensor unlock feature. no lag noticed till now. working great so far. would add later if any update in the next couple of months."
"No need of thinking too much and comparing with different handsets. The best handset available at this price. The camera is awesome, you can zoom the pic and then too it doesnt becomes blurred. The battery life is pretty good and the charging time is fabulous. The tubo charging mode is very nice. The G-sensor functions amazingly. The handset works verys moothly even after heavy use.The fingerprint sensor is excellent.No fuss in unlocking the phone.Video ecording quality is amazing. Best of MOTO in this range.."
"I think it is the best phone in this range and after I got the phone . I am right about itIt has very good camera quality . Good sensing quality. Good look. Excellent processing power.and the most important is the storage.I bought 64 gb variety and I am very satisfied with this phone.But there are also some thing not good but you can manage. I am talking about the bugs and it is not resolved but company claimed that there is no bug problem in this version.So, thats it"
"The camera quality isn't so good. The front camera sucks. It can't even capture a little bit of objects in motion. The pictures get broken and blurry after the camera update if you don't use HDR.The portrait shots aren't good either. The blur is very bad. Looking at the brand the picture quality should have been better than what we get.Little bit of heating issues too while charging or playing games."
"very good phone. Battery life is awesome, have been using it for a year now, no need to carry power bank.performance very good, dosent hang (unlike samsung), photo/video quality is okay though, no compass."
"Excellent experience with Moto yet again. Built quality, display, fastest finger print sensor, near to stock experience, good battery, no heating problem except when charging, good for gaming.every thing is fine . Would have been 5stars if some bugs in camera app. Camara is taking good photos but with 1second delay. And photos Turing little darker after talking the shots."
"The phone seems great when specs are seen, pretty huge ram and rom, nice camera specs, good processor and speed. The phone also gives an awesome feel in the hand with metal unibody. When comes to implementation, the camera and UI has few minor glitches and battery life goes a little down but Moto will surely improve with updates.Nevertheless, at this price, this phone is quite competitive."
"One star less for the disappointing camera.Dual camera doesn't work much good even in proper lighting. Depth effect and single camera also not great in comparison to other phone(Redmi A1)If dual camera is your main factor to buy this, please avoid this one"
"I ordered the phone at 11:30 pm and received it the next day at 9 am. The product is very good. The performance is amazing and the software is stock Android with no bloatware. The build quality is great and the phone feels very premium. The camera is good but low light performance is average. Display is good. The speakers are pretty loud and clear. I would recommend this to everyone."
"This phone is excellent in this price range or looks very premium but I want from Motorola Oreo update ....they doesn't given yet also I purchased this device for good gaming , camera , battery life , screen size , all that I was want it has and I want to share that one issue in this device that is it's flashlight very yellowish .....it's flashlight colour make your body like yellow colour ... anyway this phone is excellent. Thank u"
"Hi...feel free to check others out in this category. Reasons - 1. This model cannot ""cast"", which means you cannot connect this phone to bigger screens....LCD, LED, etc. 2. It does not have a call recording function. 3. Sometimes the videos i record does not get saved. The camera also goes off in between. Please check other models out before you go for this one."
"Was using Samsung J7 and got this product in exchange offer (thanks Amazon for good deal). Experience of stock android is awesome. Superb camera, great built quality, feel so good in hand. Signal reception is better than my old phone. Only user for 15 days and till now  I am very happy with this product even if though it was released almost 1 year back."
"I love moto product and i love this phone. Baught one for my brother. He also loved it. I love the camera battery backup is also vary good. Does not heatup while playing havy games like moto g4 plus."
"inspite of numerous attempts to get this to work on Jio -it did not! even with Jio's service center personnel efforts, even for Airtel the data works at such a slow speed that it feels  like 2G - maybe this particular piece has some issue otherwise from the specs the phone should be blazing fast. Either the phone has some software glitch or needs some patch to work - not sure who is the best person to help as Amazon shut doors on the day of return window closing citing you are 20 mins late. not satisfied with the device at all."
"Overall great product. Highly suggest to the camera guys. And who need better battery life and lesser charging time, moreover includes a turbocharger in the box which is a good step by the Motorola. Thumbs up for that. Best display according to me. Good processor not the the best. Say much good phone at this price. Good fingerprint reader in the phone too. Highly suggest this phone if you wanna buy at this price range."
"Picture, Sound, Features, Battery everything is good but....Screen quality is very bad....I dropped it once and the whole screen shattered...twist is nothing happened to the tempered glass(it was of good quality).If you are saying it has gorilla glass then please provide one in the phone...don't cheat us by providing cheap quality glass...Its my first moto phone and I am disappointed. never going to buy a moto product again."
"This is my second Moto phone. I've been using a Moto G2 for the last 2+ years & decided to go for Moto again based on my experience. Love the G5S plus. Pretty sleek for it's size. Good battery backup. Some of the other reviews are detailed on this. All in all a good buy."
"I have been using this mobile from last one month and till now it's working amazing.Multiple applications are running without any issue.The design is also very sleek n good lookingJust one reason I haven't given 5 star is the camera feature ""Depth Enabled"" is not strong. Same feature of xiomi A1 is far better.Rest I loved it."
"NOT SATISFACTORY, NOT UPTO THE MARK.1. ONE PORTION (TOP CENTER) OF THE TOUCH IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY2. ON CALLING, THE SCREEN BECAME BLANK AND THE PICTURE OF THE PERSON WHOME WE CALL DID NOT COME.WANT TO REPLACE, BUT GOING OUT OF COUNTRY ON 22ND APRIL 18, DONOT KNOW IF I WOULD RECEIVE IT ON TIME OR NOT, THERE IS NO CUSTOMER CARE PNONE NO. TOO.3. PHONE IS VERY SLIPPERY FROM HAND WITHOUT COVER , NEEDS SOME GRIP.QUALITY IS NOT LIKE MOTO G FIRST GENERATION, OR AFTER LENOVO HAS TAKEN OVER, THAT IS WHAT I FEEL."
"The device got scratched within 2 days . Though I had the same handset before this it did not scratch after 6 months also but this one did within 2 days . I'm very unhappy about this . I think I got a faulty one"
"This mobile is the worst I bought so far.1. The dual camera is not even produces results better than old single lens phone2. Native video facility is not provided, which is very essential support now a days.3. The video color quality is not appreciable.So many other things like compass, speedometer etc.are not provided4. Music player and gallery is not provided5. Sometimes the screen becomes partly black due to unknown reasons"
"Using it for 2 months now, no issues, no lag, no heat.Back cover feels mandatory as the metal finish is smooth and could be slippery for some.Dual Camera needs improvement but software updates can do it hopefully.Battery is superb, loved fast charging.Was using the Moto G which still has no major issuesUpgrade is worth it."
"defective product given by the seller & tedious process of replacementthey are not ready to replace the phone thought expert visit team had given replacement report.every time i call customer care, they give different reasons, sometime address deactivated or product not available (even though it is shown on the website as available ).if you want to avoid tedious process of replacement (replacement is not guaranteed) & mental stress, best is to buy in shoppe."
"This mobile phone is functioning very well. The charging time is speedy. Downloads are quick. Scrolling is smooth. No heating issues whatsoever."
"Used for a month, satisfied with the performancePros:Camera is goodBattery lasts for 16-18hrs on full charge and it takes only 1.5 to 2hrs to fully charge Cons: lens protrude out so u need to get thicker back coverHeating problem while chargingOtherwise it's best mobile for 13k"
"An excellent phone for the price bracket and never did face any issue of overheating or with the camera as posted. Yes would need a bigger battery in the next generation, at least 3600 MAh. The finger print sensor is one of the best except when your fingers are wet, and since there is no Compass do not trust WALK in Maps as in Google. Camera I have not faced any issues. Clear pictures. A good phone for the price bracket for sure and I hope they don't increase the price looking at the response for this one."
"When you are spending 16 K on a phone, you expect a good battery life at least in the beginning.The battery doesn't last even for 12 hours if you are using mobile data, it has got heating issues while charging, when you are watching videos on Youtube for long time.Apart from that phone is good."
"This device is worth every penny you are paying. Trust me you won't regret even a bit by having this device.Pros:1) Turbo Charging*2) Battery backup3) App installs quickly4)Display is best4) Feels premium in hand5)Camera is also best in this price segment. Especially the Depth mode.Cons:Nothing to complain.* Guys I would suggest you to go for this device without a second thought if you are getting this for 12,999/-"
"I have used it from last 2 months, no major issue is there. Moto g5s plus almost everything like a premium phone with our mid-range budget. Very happy and Amazon delivery also good. Hope Amazon & Moto g5s plus combination best & top of the year 2017."
"I used Mi Note 3 before it. In comparison to that it is more masculine in built.l, camera is better, screen resolution is far batter, faster. It has less battery back up than my previous as it has 3000mAh Li-ion battery but to me it is sufficient. In a sentence, it is worth buying for 16k."
"The phone is fantastic. I loved it's look and feel. Camera of this product is superb but depth effect in camera of this phone is not impressive. I'm totally disappointed of its camera quality. It's rear camera is 13+13 px is good but not fine.  This phone is good in all. Display quality, speaker, it's look and feel all are excellent. It manage all the app easily. And speed is also good.  And I also loved very much of Moto's effect and it's features. It's a mind blowing phone..  In one word it is superb. But it's depth effect is not impressive..."
"Good phone with 64 GB at this price. Turbo charging was good for two weeks. Having issues with turbo charger and phone is not charging at all. Using another phone charger for battery charging and remains in same percentage level."
"*It's feels so premium, specially one with golden color.*Very well built.* Very good performance.*Camera is way ahead of it's class.*Good battery backup lasts easily one day.*Good sound quality via speaker and sound quality from audio jack is quite impressive."
"battery charging is taking to much time...but draining of battery is very fast. Charging cable is very small. Camera is very slow to operate. I had a Moto Z play...its screen got broken, i hv given it to agartala service center...worst service providers...thats why hv to buy G5splus...buts its battery is not working 8 hours also....Amazons delivery service was good. But what happened to Motorola!!!!!!!!!!! Now it got hair line fracture over whole screen, can I get warranty?"
"After using 15 days ....I am posting the reviews .... design of the phone is well built... metallic body... speaker is decent.... camera is good bt not as expected from Moto... slightly disappointed... battery backup is also quite Good...can use whole with moderate use....as it's giving turbo charger so that charges very fast ...so no issue at all ....... Good experience while gaming no heating or no lagging...... overall it is good budget smartphone.....u can go for it if camera is not ur 1st priority.....it could have been better...I am happy with it"
"Nice option in this price segment.,, still i feel few things could have been better.. like introduction of dash charging, camera shutter delay, depth editor functionality etc.Nonetheless, what i found amazing is its sound output (loudness),, overoll picture quality , smooth gaming support , and few unique moto actions (chop, swat etc.)"
"Fantastic phone having sparking speed of processor this,phone does,not lagging during heavy game playing , camera is awesome in this range , battery backup is good, and the most important is the response of touch is owesome it take just twinkling of eye speed to change from one to another app .great I but this at very affordable price of 7250 during exchange period include 10% to I fully satisfied with this hand phone and recommended to all to go through ...."
"Ordered this the same day it was launched and now have been using this for almost a week.Battery performance is good if you are an average user. Haven't tested for gaming.Camera quality is great in the given price range and depth editing feature is awesome to get some cool shots."
"As Expected the delivered Product was well packed and the Product was perfectle delivered before the expected date.. But the thing is.. it is money for value phone.. But the purpose of dual camera.. is nthng.. portraits or very bad.. I couldnt even click one perfect portrait though.. Front Cam was good as like G5plus.. nthng new.fingerprint was good.. Sound was Ok.."
"i m happy with genuine product delivery by Amazon.its review after 2month purchased.its work smoothly with good battery backup.royal looking in ✋. camera also perfect in day light.mtlb sb thik hai es range mai.koi Chinese dabaa use krne se acha h koi genuine standard use kre.its my opinion.its has gifted  to my friend.so today i m ordered to motox4 for me.and i am writing review for g5s.bcoz i miss this product of moto."
"nice product... touch is good, most upgraded touch ever.. battery backup is gud with almost 12 hrs with continous 4G/wifi...operation is fast as of 4gb ram is useful..screen is hd with gud clearity...camera is not that gud which i expected even though its dual...phone gets heated is the bigest drawback..it can be 3.5 star but with no option hence 4 star.."
"Mobile is working as expected. The following reasons to buy the Moto G5s Plus:1. No heating problem2. Quick charging3. Moto actions4. Good display & Sound5. Fast fingerprint actions ... lovable ...6. Camera clarity is good7. Model and Finishing is nice"
"Its been a week. Despite of amazon's poor packaging everything its worth while. No issues so far. Good with games and if camera is not the priority its best in its range. Camera good for outdoors and landscapes. Feels elegant with gadget shieldz's phone protector, recommend using gadget shieldz product. You ll feel different. Everything is worth the money. And above all best part is ""hello moto :) """
"Using Moto G5S plus since 1 month, everything is good, nice speaker sound quality, in ear sound quality is average,no lags while  multitasking, nice camera quality, depth mode is not good compare to Mi A1, unfortunately Moto does not give system updates on time, No security updates on time, Still Oreo not available for moto g5s plus, it's annoying, overall good purchase in 13000."
"Phone is pretty good... Camera is awesome one... Small disappoint in shutter lag... No hanging while playing games... No heating problem... But heating slightly while charging, its common in all android phones... Its charges very fastly..  worth for money... But i disappointed with the new software update its stopped lots of application.... Anyway phone s jus awesome... Go for it...."
"Got it delivered before the expected date....Best phone at this price range if compared with any other phones.... using from 4 days and loving it....no issues found yet...!!Good cameras (Both rear and front) in daylight....slightly dull in low light.... flash is not very powerfullPerformance : Fast processor no hangs or glitchesFingerprint sensor also too good..Battery last one full day with heavy uses also.... and charges up quickly with turbo charger... gets slightly heated while charging....Everything is perfect otherwise... Fully satisfied with Moto G5s+"
"For the price it is being sold for, the phone really meets all my expectations. It has not troubles and works like silk. The camera issue is not so huge to think of - yes it is quite on the lower side than its counterparts from other brands. However, the phone works brilliantly to perfection. The phone is priced well in the mid - range to accommodate buyers of all strata. It really is a great phone to have."
"Best ruling phone within this budget, feels light and premium. Interface is smooth. Barest minimum heating only when little charging. Sound quality is awesome. A great deal phone in this budget if you want to feel stock Android ! Just go for it !!!"
"I love moto phones. The price they give the specialities in phone is awesome. Internal memory they give will not sufficient. The phone we can use for one and half year with proper condition"
"Great build qualityFast chargingAwesome camera front and back with flash at front and backLoud and clear speakerPremium lookSuper fast processorGreat battery lifeIt's a complete package with the durability of moto...Just Wow"
"It's display has developed a patch of about 2 inch width on the bottom side, barely after using it for 2 months. May be it is design flaw or individual piece is defective. The set has neither been dropped nor has come in contact with water. Primarily being used at home. Approached Motorola service centre today, who say it is damaged, due to high pressure. What the hell people give bullshit reason for not accepting the warranty, . There is apparently no damage to the set."
"Bought on April-2018 still now its going good.. gets heat wen only charging .. not while using data.  First time using Moto, mobile s quite easy to handle, display whr classy so no need of using tempered glass bcoz of it designed by gorilla glass 3 , front and rear camera r good enough as much as for mobiles, music is better than HTC one 9 prime wat were I'm used last, and Amazon service is also good,  rest of tat heard moto mobile works great, i too hope so lets see."
"Thanks to Moto. Improve camera quality even if it is having dial cam. Compared with MI feel that it's less. Also please enable the option for mobile buyers to get turbo charger original from company as like the new one which got along with mobile. Because once we lost it is hard and tough for us to get the same quality turbo original brand charger ."
"Disappointed with the rear view camera. Surprisingly the front cam seems to b better than the rear. Otherwise a good one to handle. Disappointed as the cam quality of past motos was far better than this and being a budget friendly one even a few lower end phones have a much better cam quality."
"Amazing Phone with Great quality.Pros.ContemporaryHigh qualityNo lagAdequate & timely updatesGood call & data qualityFast chargingStock Android (way better than any mod)Both cameras decent quality in classCons.Battery lasts only one day of regular usage.Body get scratches easily (good cover req.)"
"Minus point:1. Average Image Processing.2. Moto Display works on motion to show Time, it gets a bit annoying while driving a car... lol, display gets ON again and again.Except this everything is perfect and Best Buy in Budget Phone !!"
"Best mobile for Bloggers to take photos and video.I wanted a mobile for my blog which must have good video and photo quality. This mobile is superb. see my videos on youtube channel ""riderkk"" for video quality."
"The first one i bought got shattered in 2 months as it is too slippery and i didn't use any cover/glass. Repairs cost 6000 and a week's time so I decided to buy again. This time with coverNice turbo charger, nice screen size, brightness and resolution. Ringtone can be disturbingly loud. Can't miss an alarm.Camera quality is good.Good battery life. Lasts full day with heavy use."
"Nice phone.Pros-1. Better built2. Fast fingerprint reader with multiple functions3.turbo chargingCons-1 no usb type c charging2. No infrared sensor like mi A13. Not android one device4. No amplifier jack like mi a1ThanksOverall the phone is good and can serve the cost it is presented at. Thanks"
"Purchase karte samaye miA1 aur moto g5s plus me confused tha ki kaun sa lu . Finally g5s plus liya.camera starting me 13 mp jaisa nai laga par phone update karne ke baad camera  se related sari problem solve ho gaya. battery life acchi h .Gorilla glass quality acchi h screen gaurd nai lagana pada.phn ki speed acchi h hanging problem nai h.iska back look bahot acchi h . Specially iska gold version bahot accha h .mai phn ke performance se bahot khus hu . Iska fast charging bahot accha h 1 hour me lagbhag battery full ho jati h"
"No doubt regarding long term ownership as bought on 24 SEP .....good camera , gud battery back , only drawback is it doesn't support VOLTE ..... As per the market it should be b/w 8500-9000 only....otherwise don't go for it....as you will get old manufactured model"
"This is one of the best phone i have ever seen. Purchased 2 for my family members. And one for my friend. Camera is its USP. Low light photography is also good. Design is sleek and robust."
"Battery backup, screen, fingerprint sensor is good. But camera, Call quality and mic are bad. My voice is not heard with the internet on. Looks like a software and hardware issue. Camera software is bad and image looks under exposed most of the times. Didn't live up to the expectation. This is my second Moto and will be my last one. Disappointed!"
"I love this mobile for the money I paid(13999). I wanted a mobile with stock Android  and my other choice was MI A1. It was out of stock and I left with  this one and I don't regret because I think camera and screen quality is good for this mobile and I got for same price as MI A1. I am a moderate user,  using mobile mainly for checking emails, chat and YouTube videos. I never faced any heating issues with moderate use. Battery charge also lasting for 2 days."
"It is an average product considering the price tag. Products from other manufacturers like Xiaomi with more or less same configuration are available 10%-20% cheaper. I paid more because of Motorola brand name but feel let down especially by primary (rear) camera performance and battery life. LED notification light and magnetometer sensor, which are found even in cheaper phones, are missing."
"As per my suggestion : Don't buy this product or any product of Lenovo or Motorola because Company's focus is only on Sell not on providing any important update like Mi company is providing every month regularly.I have purchased Moto G5s Plus last year in November but not receiving any update as per their commitment at the time of sell last year."
"I am using this since last three months it hangs sometimes . Before it I used Moto G2 having only 1 gb ram but working smoothly than Moto gs 5 plus.Lenovo reduce the quality of Moto. Bad experience with Lenovo.Now never by Lenovo manufactured product."
"Phone is good. But after security patch update front camera and flash stopped working. No luck even after multiple recovery attempts. Finally had to order for replacement. Had gone through so much of replacement procedures, and finally got the phone replaced by a new one after a week of struggle. Delivery was horrible, I had to follow up with customer support so many times as it was not delivered on the promised date."
"Very good phone. Super performance. Throw anything to it , and it will handle. But a manufacturer defect is there. After a month or so you will find dust inside one of the camera lens because of secondary microphone hole present above cameras. So after buying I suggest to cover that hole with plastic tape to avoid dust inside camera.Otherwise awesome phone for price range"
"It's a very superb one, everything is unbelievable,Charming  look, DSLR like camera , best backup,amazing function and allLunar grey is better than gold one...Thanks Moto ,"
"Using from 15 days...when we use one sim network is fine but when i use 2 sims... network fluctuate too much between 4G and 3G.Its very irritating."
"Quite an android classic or a typical android device. Call it anything. This device outstands all other android devices in its range. Right from the product's display to its battery life, everything in place and the display is commendable to. Amazon as usual impressive with its lightning delivery.Motorola has done a good job in getting together all the necessary hardware together to end up with something like this."
"Writing review after using for 6months Good mobile...camera in  potriot mode just lags but picture qulity is better in Mi A1 than Moto g5s plus.  And most worst part is Moto is owned by Lenovo now and Lenovo has ruined the name of Moto because Moto previously had name for giving early os update for it's users but now we are not getting update even after 6-7 months...so overall don't prefer for Moto mobile as it's not previously known moto.. Google please take it back from Lenovo it's request  by loyal Moto customer....."
"When i bought the phone I was not really so sure about its camera performance as the reviews were not that good, all the lag and stuff.Out of the box , yeah, those things were true. But once you update it, all the issues are gone! Bingo! And the pics😍!  I've attached one. No filter applied.Performance is snappy. You will not notice a lag. I don't do gaming much so I can't comment on that part. It runs cool all the time, except while charging. But that happens with all the turbo chargers."
"Awesome device, not sure of the rear camera when compared to A8(2015 model)...WORST part is the headset, one can get a better quality for 50 rupees from a flee market...Battery back up, resolution, speed, turbo charger etc are very impressive.."
"I had raised issue with this mobile much before the end of Returnable date, wherein randomly in lower part of the screen disturbance is seen. Accordingly a Amazon technician came but this random occurence did not occur, so he left giving me one receipt. This issue is really affecting my eyes and is very irritating. I am therefore requesting you, please replace this mobile phone with a good phone.Amazon Team please help on this. Amount of Rs. 13999/- is very huge for me."
"As of now, I am very satisfied with this phone. Latest budget phone with android 7.1.1 & Dual camera. Great piece. Will update later only if I find any issues."
"I like this mobile, the features contained in mobile are good, battery charging is also good, hardly 1.5 hours time taken mobile to chargedBut this mobile did not going calls directly with jio sim, after installing jio calls app and from that we can make calls  but it uses mobile data to make callsFinally it does not support volte jio simIt support LTE only"
"Great experience with motoPros.:-1) Smooth stock android experience2)Good battery backup3) excellent display4)fast charging5)Rear camera works fine6) fastprocesser7) Android ver 7.1 👍Con:-1)from camera lag in low light condition2)depth mode needs update3)earpiece sound not up to the mark"
"I got it in 10k after applying to offer. Must buy in this range. Amazon delivered me to just next day. There are some pros and cons-Pros-  battery life, display, ROM, RAMCons- camera quality can be improved. Depth enabled picture take so much time to save and dual SIM slot apart from SD card slot should be there."
"As usual needless to say another very good mobile with nice build quality, very good looking and performance found.Being a Moto G1 user I was most satisfied and now after a use of 15 days seems like another purchase of mine this moto gonna break it's the last record as well."
"An Average phone... With decent cameras... The dual setup cameras feels a waste as they don't offer much at hand... And as the camera have a bump.. they are prone to scratches... Low light photography is ok and front camera is average.... Infact the Moto G4 plus which had a single 16mp camera outperforms the G5s plus in most parts.. The only positive things about this phone is it's vibrant screen, stock android and turbo charging..."
"Best one under 15k, both 📷 are good,powerful battery charging,nice working,  loud 🔊's I am feeling happy about features overall mobile is good but the drawback is VOLTE network support is not available to this device disappointed about that rest is very good mobile both Sim1 4g  sim2 3g Amazon describes about network both are 4g supports cheating the customers"
"The product was good and looks awesome. But the mobile was too slippery and the dual camera wasn't the best. At this price range they should have provided more"
"The phone us awesome.. Features are very Good..Smooth while using..Jst a query ? N require a quick reply..I hv bought this phone on 20th October n while buying the phone i hd been promised 10% cashback on using the Sbi card for purchase..I used the same card of mine...Its over 15 days now...hv received my cash back yet..can u let me knw wats causing the delay? Thanks.."
"Superb PhoneThere is no depth mode adjustment bar missing as given in previous reviews.Overall Nice , handy, classy, sexy phone.Just go for it without thinking.Moto is way far better than mi, coolpad or any other chinese devices."
"Fast FingerPrint Senson, Excellent Battery Life and Mutli tasking Performane. But The Camera is not Upto the mark. Depth Enables mode takes quite a long time to process image and most of the time there is focus issue on it. Indoor Lighting camera performance is also just around average. G5 plus camera is infact much better in terms of capturing more light in the picture due to lesser pixel size."
"Great phone, only hitch is at times it switches off. Having used a samsung before I find it a bit difficult in terms of being user friendly. Amazing camera and very good sound clarity as well. Battery life is okay, excellent speed and great memory for someone who uses the phone to save loads of files and apps. Overall happy with the phone"
"You will love the fast charging and low light camera. Performance is good and also the battery. Now as the prices slashed, go for it if you want a good phone right now. Also order some good quality screen protector and a back cover that protects the rear camera bump along with the device."
"Using Moto G5s Plus for 3 weeks.Pros : Very Good build quality.Camera is very good, front as well as back.Latest Android version 7.1.1 Nougat smooth experience.Sleek and sturdy phone with premium looks.Cons: Camera bump on rear"
"Nice experience till now after using for one month. Only problem is unread messages count and missed call count and all the counts on applications like WhatsApp are not displayed on top of the applications as it was showing up in earlier versions of Android. You have to open up message app to check how many unread msg are there. This is annoying."
"Mobile is awesome. It took 10 days to deliver by Amazon, but it was stated, so no issues.Mobile looks flawless, awesome screen.It's back camera feels odd. It is coming out of body, and doesnt look good.Otherwise, mobile is good to have."
"The dual camera setup basically brings no improvement, neither the deapth mode is good nor is the detail in pictures better than its predecessor.The phone does look better for sure, with it's larger screen and better screen to body ratio, but the trade off is with the one handed grip, which was easier with G5 Plus.I am a fan of one button navigation, which is why I bought this phone.I think one would be better off buying the old Moto G5 plus, it's almost the same."
"I have brought this product on November 2017. Till the time i haven't faced any problem.But only bad thing about moto, you all know that headphone provided by them are very very bad. So only this reason i have given 4 star. Otherwise phone quality, performance, camera, battery life are best enough in this price. Thank You Moto."
"Awesome product...Great config...Light in hand...Quick chargingLiked the camera also but still prefer the camera of moto x play which I owned before this...Had a much smoother experience...Hope Moto comes up with some software updates for the camera"
"Have celhecked the exchange value for this phone it is valued lower than G5 even though it is next gen phone after G5. Supperb work amazon."
"I have been using G5s plus phone for a month now honestly the phone is really cool in terms of camera and overall performance. I have an issue with the data usage whenever I switch on airtel sim for data my vodafone signal turns off which makes impossible to make or receive calls. Can some help me out in this regard.  Battery could have 4000 mah with the given price."
"Everything is good about this phone. Only problem/issue I found is with casting options. Google, in order to promote Chrome Cast has disabled the casting on other devices which as based on Mira Cast or similar other technologies. I have Moto X Play and that is easily able to cast to my Samsung smart TV, but not this phone. Though the problem is not with Motorola, but with Android, still this is a feature that this phone lacks and I personally wanted this to be part of my phone."
"Not Up to the mark... Expected more about G5splus but there is nothing much good.1- Dull UI colors.2- It's 2ghz processor, but its not supporting Mortal Kombat X game. My old phone j7 supported MKX really good.3- Camera was bad. Not crispy and sharp and it doesn't look like 13mp. Not at all autofocusing fast. Depth of field option really bad. K8 note depth of field is better.Look and feel is good, very light weight but when there is no good processor even u have 4gb ram then it's useless to buy."
"Moto G5 S+ is a great phone in this price bracket and does well above other players in the same range.I am a iPhone X user and bought it for someone who wanted around 15k rupees.I am constantly reviewing the product and I have got the satisfaction with my purchase.Definitely would recommend this product in this price bracket."
"Fast delivery by Amazon and the Moto G5 a plus is too good nice phone by Motorola. Camera quality is good. No heating issue even you play 4-5 havey games like Modern combat, need for speed etc. Metal fenishing is too good. Speeker is too louder mice quality is good. Overall phone is awesome in this price range."
"Extra ordinary phone ,super display,a phone worth the price.Snapdragon processor makes it even sweet.There is some shutter lag but the photos turn out to be outstanding.A must buy phone.Worth the price.if u are going to buy,go for it."
"Excellent mobile with great screen display & camera quality, fast processing, loud & clear speaker sound except for battery could have been little more better but if you are a medium user single full charge will be ok for a 9 to 9 day but a heavy user might have to take an extra charge! Turbo charger is excellent! Great buy within 15K!"
"I have been using this phone for last 8 months. I am happy with its performance. Battery lasts a whole day with data enabled all the time. Camera quality is good enough for normal usage. I havent faced any issue in day to day usage, its still as fast as it was on day one."
"Bought this phone a few weeks ago. Barring a few problems the phone is working fine. Camera is good ( both rear and front). Battery life is not too good but has enough juice to last a full day if not used too much for gaming or watching videos.Sometimes a few apps crash and that is an area of concern ( hope it can be rectified by an software update ).Overall an average phone."
"Amazing ProductGood look,  metal finishedDual Camera quality awesome....Front camera quality good flash also niceHandling option very smooth....Fast chargingDisadvantageNo photo Gallery App,  only visible to Google photos.Battery back up very low"
"E series are better than G seriesG series mobiles are very delicate pieceMy cell got damage on back side body when it fall from 12 inches distance and it was in mobile cover. I had to pay 4500 for repairingPlease don't buy Motorola mobiles aa they don't give first service for free, is Samsung or Oppo mobiles give"
"Best phone with attractive exchange offer and very happy with the phone after usage of 4- days.Must say one should go for it without thinking once in this segment where 4gb Ram and 64 GB internal memory available in above 22k with other brands except Mi 4A. The only thing is 3000 MAH battery could be improved.. but with this as well drains after 1.5 day...really happy"
"1.Camera performance is very very  poor and most the portrait mode has  lages and edges.compare photos with mi note 5 pro or miA1 and any other dual camera and different you can see.2.Bettery performance is very bad.it had turbo charger however bettery drained very fast and slow charging problem is too.3.I bought it till 3 months and slow charging problem has been started.many times the battery could not charge!4.selfie camera is too bad it's auto face beauty is not proper"
"It's been 3 months now and the phone battery & connectors need a change. the motorola service center did replaced, but they DO NOT want to attend the display issue as their testing tools could not find any issue. But the store manager see the gray part of the screen while it is OFF. Not sure what amazon & motorol can do - but i am stuck with this issue & no support from motorola. Seems i got a FAULTY Unit from Amazon. Totally frustrating experience."
"This device looks so good,its metal body gives a really great feel,the camera quality is great, both front and back. Powered with android it has a near to stock android expereince which is super fast. I would recommend this to everyone wanting a phone in this price range."
"Phone is very good. Its also charge in lass time. Camera bump is the problem, it can be Barack if you will not care it. If you got a messsage then there is no sing, you have to access the message app."
"Its been almost 3 weeks i started using this phone.ProsDisplay is goodGestures work wellCharging worksConsPhone has inherent problem with audio jack, found many people with same issue. Now i have to go to service center with new phone to get fixedBattery drains faster as phone uses data even when data is connection is off"
"Well I have been using it for the last few days and I am having a great experience with this productThe camera is good the performance is great.The turbo charger is the best part but it gets a bit heated up while chargingSo far the best phone in its range"
"So far it is working good. No glitches.While I have observed that the phone heats up while charging with Turbo Charger, it is not a big issue, assuming Motorola must have considered this (not a threat).Overall good mobile phone. Good camera."
"Camera quality was very bad, in full day light also front camera looking dark and main cam also dull, call quality also not good in many of the calls voice was breaking and some times not audible. Once think before buying once u buy this no return, no exchange only replacement for this product. I'm writing this product after 4 months my mobile touch screen was broken very soon and I think original accessories not given also ear phones are very cheap stopped working I buy it for 14999/- RS."
"Awesome experience thanks Amazon.mobile is really really very nice.camera quality is oh my god killer.bhari aahe mobile ekdam kadak"
"Excellent phone. Has all necessary features at minimal cost. Will be a decent update from <10000 rs phones. Head phone provided by company is a disaster. Decent battery if you don't over kill it. Fast update s from Android"
"Really nice phone. Works great, battery life is also great. One charge works for almost 2 days with fair amount of usage."
"Pros:decent lookmetalic bodyturbo chargingSplit screenone button navigationGood performancecons:1.protruded out rear camera  If moto provide rear camera lens cover that wouldbe fine2.camera  Colour reproduction is not good and sometime looks very bad  Depth mode not working fine means it cant identify the object correctly  If MOTO improve this issues in oreo update I will be giving 5 starsoverall:apart from camera issues its a nice phone"

"Very nice Product by Motorola as it provides the wide range of features.Pros:Better battery back uplightweightfast chargingspeedCamera QualityOverall the phone is worth buy"
"Nice, sturdy phone with great specification. Comes with d brand name of Motorola and it does not disappoint. Prior to this was using Moto g (1st Gen). Nice UI and features. Battery life is good and I have faced no heating problem until now ( using this for over a month). Turbo charging is a great feature. Go for it if you are a Moto fan."
