      "Its been just a month since I bought this phone and there is a problem with the battery now It says it requires 15 hours to fully charge the battery and after charging the phone for 3 to 4 hours the battery drains quickly within a few hours I want to return this product because I dont think any phone should cause a problem in a month\n",
      "I am using this phone from past 6 months and I can say that it has a lot of basic issues The battery percentage decreases while charging The problem is not yet sorted out by moto and lots of user are complaining the same One more issue which lots of users are experiencing is low incall  outcall speaker volume The volume is horribly low and you cant hear anything on call in noisy area You need a very quiet place to call or receive a call Moto under lenevo is digging its own grave Moto has not been able to solve any of its issue You can visit lenevo forum to see lots of complaints from users I strongly recommend its time to say goodbye to moto and purchase some other mobile\n",
      "Dont buy this product it will be a waste of money Within 15 mins of charging the handset heats up very much Also using apps for 15 to 20 minutes  continuously the handset heats up Within  few days I was replaced with a new handset but that was also having the same issue I dont understand how come Amazon is selling a defective product online Now its up too you guys wanna waste your hard own money \n",
      "Whatever motorola is promoting is not getting delivered in actualCharger stopped functioning within 3months of purchaseI have checked this issue with G4 and G5 using my friendsall confirmed that charger became non functional within 6 months of timePlease dont try the turbocharger technology in coming phones as you cant meet the expectation in actual\n",
      "I have been using this product since last one year and I m not convinced what moto gave usPros 1Phone feels solid in hands2The single button navigation is provide good features 3 The most I liked in it is the chop chop sensorsCons1 The camera quality is not up to the mark which earlier they said about it however after the software update there are some changes but doesnt change a lot2The turbo charger provided with it is stopped working3 There are some network issues which I feel in it4 The processor is not so fast after the usage of almost one year\n",
      "Best mobile under 16000 4gb ram with 64 GBMobile interface and screen is good  Turbo charger gives your  battery 100 in just 2030mins which works up to  8hrCamera wise  rear dual camera  is best for photography  While front camera lags with clarity  In daylight  front camera gives good pic but in night although  it has selfie flash it cant give you that much of satisfaction  for selfiesYou can do multitasking in 2 windowsGiving rating 4 only for its front camera  Overall moto g5s plus os best buy under 16000\n",
      "Its the best in this mid range section But the camera quality is not as it was expected Specially in that portrait modeThought motorola was best But its been more than 6 months android oreo update hasnt been rolled out yet After lenovo has bought moto The level of moto has been decreasing\n",
      "First item came with dead battery The phone didnt booted up Service guy inspected and sent replacement Screen quality is over saturated Eyes will feel uncomfort Battery wuality is low Not lasting even complete 810 hrs with low to moderate use Phone is too bulky with no special or basic smartphone features Much better products availabile for this price range\n",
      "I bought this phone at a price of Rs10 750 on prime day sale  with HDFC card benefits and I am really happy with its performance at that price  if we can recall most phones comes either as 3 GB 32 GB or 4 GB and 64 GB storage variants with different price tags and this phone is pure Android with less blotware moreover for torrenting and watching movies at same time this set is awesome as this would be understood by those who do torrenting via phone and watch a movie at same time Most phones gets laggy or even frozen I tried with many sets Redmi  Honor Lenovo etc and if we have the patience contact Amazon customer service I replaced my faulty set with their support than complain about the faulty phone Overall good but wish I get oreo update before I turn 30\n",
      "the quality of moto phones have degraded severely after lenovo took over the company having a pathetic experience with the phone right now the gorilla glass isnt strong as before i have no games or huge apps still the phone lags a lot need to restart it 34 times a day to control lagging do not go for any moto products\n",
      "If you are purchasing this phone to recieve latest updates faster then go for Mi A1 Three trend of receiving faster updates on Moto devices ends with Moto G5s plus Its July 2018 almost nearing to Android p and we are still waiting for Android O I did a mistake of purchasing this device I did a mistake by purchasing this phone is not in the list to get android pie update Motorola ended support in just a year Probably this is my last Motorola purchase everAlso call recorders dont work No idea why\n",
      "Moto G5S Plus has got everything that you look for in a phone with a budget of 1516k And this phone worth every penny of itStarting from Strong processorExcellent RAM managementAmazing gaming experience eg ASPHALT 9 runs smoothly on it and playing PUBG with this high screen resolution and 55inch and brilliant surround sound is really a BOONCamera works decent sometimes picture get blur in processing after clicking software issue needs update otherwise quality is fine especially Portrait mode is really goodBattery backup is really impressive 100 charged will definitely last for a day and a half with a fair amount of use ie calls WhatsApp and even by watching some videosIn love with turbo charger 15 mins charging is really sufficient for a backup of 56 hours or you can watch a whole movie by thatMOTO ACTIONS this thing gets me everytime and trust me itll make your life easier somewhere somehowAlso Finger print sensorscanner is very quick and responsiveSo thats it as I said it got everything BUT the only cons which came across while using it for 5months are1Compass sensor missing hardly matters 2Metal back and camera bulged part demands a good back cover or a case as it would easily get scratched up as shown in the only pic shared rest of the pics of the phone youll get everywhere avoid iPAKY covers for this set result you just have seen3 Slow Android update still running on Marshmallow as announced expecting OREO by the end of SeptemberAnd at last4 NO SCREEN CASTING  MIRROR function which is a big disappointmentThank you hope this helps you to make your choiceAll The Best\n",
      "Good for photography and battery has a good life\n",
      "The phone updates constantly but restarts on its own Had to return the first piece as it was restarting too many times in its own Screen is very fragile Will break if you sit with the phones in your front pocket Camera is pathetic Dual camera set up is for show Doesnt work Battery life is just for one working day Cant go the next day even with minimal usage WiFi is weak Headphones given are trash Since the screen is curved at the ends screen protectors dont hang on for long Water is biggest event Was driving with two phones in my pocket This ones WiFi stopped working wheres the other phone had no issues at all which by the way was a Samsung Avoid this phone\n",
      "This motolenevo smartphone is a beast at this price The screen looks amazing and vibrant which is a 55 inch IPS LCD 16 m colour screen with Corning Gorilla glass 3 The processor is Snapdragon 625 20 GHz with Android 71nougat witch is pretty fast and no problem with multitasking The best thing about this phone is its camera which comes with 1313 mp dual rear camera with of course dual LED flash which takes amazing shots The pictures quality from this camera ia awesome And for selfie it has 8 mp which also take Amazing selfie with portrait mode The sound quality is good but could have been better considering the price Only thing let me down a little bit is the battery which is only 3000mAh but it comes with fast charger which charges the phone fully in about 4560 mins so that is even Steven Sensor are fingerprint which is fast and accuracy is good accelerometer n etc\n",
      "This product Moto G5S Plus is very good and functioning properly  Sadly for the past month or so the charger is not workingWas wondering what to do when I checked and found that the inbox accessories have a six month warrantyAccordingly I need the phone charger to be replaced  Pl advise  Many thanks TV Subramaniyan Mobile 91 9560840920\n",
      "Though it is a Motorola device which was known for its blazing fast SW updates but thats not the case with this one anymore It has been a year now since it was launched into the market but no Android 81 till now It runs on Android 711 which still is very buggy Battery has not been optimized well as it shows falls battery percentage I would not recommend this phone at this point now You can have a look at the new Nokia devices They are actually doing what Motorola was suppose to do Or even Xiomi phones are giving a really very good value for money Which is not the case with Motorola\n",
      "Very good phone Pic quality is superb snaps are taken in a jiffy just like an iPhoneBut I dont like the fact that it doesnt have a Native Photos app but uses Googles Photo appAlso not many Security features are available to safegaurd the phone from Hackers These have become a Standard feature in Samsung Phones Which could be a primary reason that when I plan to upgrade from this unit I might prefer to buy a Samsung instead of G6 Plus\n",
      "Build Quality Good Its slim Initially i found it difficult to hold  fear of slipping from hand as it has big size but you feel good becoz of metallic body  front curved glass Finger print sensor is good Camera is ok Speed is ok Rear camera is bulging out so there is fear of getting scratched however company claims glass to be of good quality It depends on Individual usage also I have a very rough n tough usage so i have purchased a diary type  cover\n",
      "I have been using Samsung phones since long but after buying this product I feel its not only value for money but has more features then any other phone available in the market Processor is fast while multitasking  The picture quality is superb and the camera is brilliant in still and video shoots It has a good battery backup and a quick charger is fantastic Security features are great with ample storage space I would definitely recommend this phone\n",
      "This phone is clearly of more worth I was thinking of buying Mi A1 but after watching many reviews decided to go for it Best phone under 20k bracket\n",
      "it is a grate phoneit cost only 14000 INR  it has 4GB RAM and 64GB internal memory expandable up to 128GB which is grate in this price pointits has 1313MP dual back camera f20 dual LED flash and 8MP front facing camera with flash  its screen is 1397cms 55inch Full HD 1080 x 1920 capacitive touchscreen with Gorilla Glass 3 protectionits runs on  Android v71 Nougat operating system with 20GHz Snapdragon 625 octacore processor which is grate for multitasking  but the most important is battery 3000mAH Lithiumion battery with 15W Turbo Charging with only  20 minute charging it runs about 67 hours \n",

      "The product I got had a white spot on the displayso amazon gave me a full refundThanks amazonAbout the product at this price 12000 rupees there is no better phone than this one It took 3 days for amazon for the return process to complete and I tested the device I am writing this review by judging it for the price of 12000 not the original 17000 rupees priceBUILD QUALITYThe first thing you will notice is the build quality The full metal body is amazing to hold doesnt slip the camera bump looks beautiful use microfibre cloth to clean as small threads gets stuck in it Simply the phone is beautiful with a strong build qualityCAMERAIn this price range it is the best camera phone Daylight shots are amazing and night shots are good enough not that great but good The bokeh effect is also amazingafter updating the camera app it gets better and oreo update is coming soon that too will increase the camera performance There are also various modes to play with The camera provides realistic colour Some people say the color is yellowish but I think that it replicates the exact color that I can see with my eyes  sunlight is yellow not whiteduh The macro shots also look great but you cannot get too close to the subject I liked the front camera very much The front panaroma group selfie is amazing The front flash lightens up the darkest rooms Front cam also has the manual mode Without beautification the camera provides realistic image With beautification it doesnt make your skin like plastic and white like on other phones The video performance is amazing on every modeSOFTWAREThe stock Android with moto apps Works like a charm Nuff saidBATTERY and PERFORMANCEThe 3000 mAh battery gives a full day typical use from 100 to 0 If you use phone a lot for camera gaming etc it works for about 67 hours If you are gaming only it works for about 45 hours while playing PUBG Please note that pubg is still not optimized well even for the flagship phones PUBG shows no lag If you want to play games for a whole day like me that is where the turbo charger comes in It can charge your phone from 0 to 100 in just 1hr 20 mins Average apps like Facebook Instagram etc works flawlessly There is no lag in the phoneI had to go to college phone was at 20 charged it for 30 mins and then again it was 65 People complaining about battery are not considering that they are getting a turbo chargerPhone gets warm while charging So dont play games whilst charging for a longer battery healthSOUND QUALITYSpeakers had good bass and treble and were loud enough to hear in a crowded room It has a 35 mm jack with good audio outputDISPLAYDisplay is very good with sharp images It is slightly warmer in color but that too will change with the oreo update or  you can use any other app to change color temperature The moto display is very useful as it doesnt have a physical notification light It also saves batterySo in conclusion at 12000 rupeesthe phone is amazing buy without thinking twice before it gets out of stock And if you have any issue you can easily return the phone and get your money back I had the white spot in display issue They gave me my money back and again I have ordered this phoneI hope this time I will not get any of that issuePS I love the moto boot animation\n",
      "I had a moto G4 plus earlier was pretty happy with that phone so thought of going with next moto phone G5s plusSome reason the phone set i got is not good in performance1 Did not notice issues initial few days but after a week phone gets hung so many times in spite of i have updated phone with all updates it was flashing Mot many app installed2 Unlock sensor sometime is not responsive3 Had to restart phone 23 times a day it really irritates4 Got a faulty charger with phone it only shows power sign that too goes and come back5 Will visit service center for these issues\n",

      "The phone is great if you are tight on budget and yet want something that gives a competent performance for daily tasks But for me the phone looks great and feels good and works quite efficientlyNow post 8 months of usage I would like to say my major complaint with Motorola is they are so so late with security and system updates It is frustrating Given they released Android Oreo 81 updates in May 2018 for this handset it is still in some Soak Test phase as their customer executive says which they mentioned can take any amount of time Only after that will they release the update\n",
      "This phone is overheated when I am 15 mints call to continue as well as when we to go for the battery charge same issue of overheat and right now phone charger is not working this issue facing last 2 monthWhen went to the authorized service center of Moto G in Karnal and Gurgaon then not support and deny for support due to the original bill As per received mail from your end or create a new bill from click option and find a new invoice copy but authorized service center is demanding for original phone bill with mentioned the EMI number on bill paper From shared you end we are not getting those type of bill which mentions these EMI number so please help me out and support as soon as possible and share the original bill or take alternative solution  Phone under warranty Please find the attached phone invoice copy for your reference\n",
      "Being a Moto fan and having used Moto G2 for almost a year I thought I was in for some really good camera as Moto G2 also had a good camera and this one claimed to be a much better one with its dualfocus rear camera But to my utter disappointment the pictures this phone takes are in no way amazing Colors do not come proper Bright light photography is good though but low light is a pain including well lit indoorsOtherwise the phone feels sturdy in hands and can survive a few drops has a good battery life if used continuously for talking and playing around apps it lasts a day or more The phone does not hang and gives good performance It heats while charging especially if it is being used while charging which is expected\n",
      "Good productI purchased with by back of Moto G4 S plus I received a faulty deviceBut after me talking with Amazon representatives they have replaced a new device within 24 hrsThe team support was very goodThey are understandable personsThank you Amazon\n",
      "Pros Very good build quality with a nice premium feel  Phone feels fast and responsive  No bloatware and whatever Motorola has added are really useful  Decent CameraCons That nice metallic feel has a downside the phone is very slippery I almost dropped it a couple of times  The fingerprint reader is oversensitive  I can feel it in my pocket when I move around and it get pressed to my chest  Took me a while to  figure out why the phone keeps vibrating in my pocket when there are no notifications  No notification light coming from a flagship Samsung I really miss that  I am not too impressed with the Moto display functionAn update Overall still happy with the phone but very very DISAPPOINTED that there is no Oreo update yet  Reducing to three stars\n",
      "Sleek sturdy smooth  suave Great turbopowered battery Efficiently running without any hitch so far A commendable product brought to my door by Amazon The audio headset is less than ordinary though it should have matched the superiority of the phone\n",
      "Solid device No heatingnice camera and good battery life Screen is bright and nice color reproduction Cam clarity is good but colors are bit saturated and not much use of dual cam setupperformance is okay for day to day usefast charging is really fast until 90 then slows downbattery lasts a day and half\n",
      "Absolutely amazing phone by MotorolaThe camera is Good Not superb But good one for the costThe battery backup is good I play NFS racing games all the day internet is on and keep on checking news whatsapp hangout lots of emails etc A full charge in morning and its still 3040  remaining till late nightTurbo charger is the best thing given by Motorola Charges up mobile super fastFast multitasking and processingGo for it as the device is awesome for the cost\n",
      "Overall a good device till now It has FM radio in it thats one of the USP of  most of mid range phone Its not mentioned anywhere in amazonmoto websiteAll features works good as expected and stunning finger print response and no lags with so many apps running\n",
      "Good product with limitations like we can only put 2 Sims or 1 sim and 1 sd card If you use 2 sims sim2 dont have 4G selection option only 3G My recommendation go for it Advise is relook into this product price\n",
      "The delivery was spot onwas delivered in 48 hours of being ordered As to how good the phone is will have to use for a while to confirmbut this is my 3rd moto g  the other 2 have followed the same pattern  good use for about a year then something breaks I get the outer cover replaced after which the phone is fine for another 6 months then it begins dialing people on my speed dial automatically at which point I replace the phone this phone looks good and for the first 48 hours of usage all is well\n",
      "I have been used Moto G5s plus last 20 daysSatisfied Charging system is turbo that can be charged my phone within 15 minutes 30 to 40  Processor speed is GoodNot Satisfied Camera has not captured cleanupRear camera not captured properlyCamera has been quickly scratchedTotally waste of money Dont buy this phone\n",
      "Had ordered this phone for my mom As usual Amazon order arrived on time It was properly packed box was sealed and product had everything expected packed in No issues there at all Only grouse is that Motorola is extremely slow to push software and security updates despite the phone having near stock android Also the camera is good but dont have huge expectations thinking its a dual camera setup Its after all a budget phone and so photos are good but far from great\n",
      "After using for 3 weeks here is my take on the phone  It does all the basics perfectly Battery life is quite impressive Love the Moto mods such as ambient display of notifications etcthey work flawlessly Bugs in Bluetooth software is causing battery drain  hopefully it will get fixed in next update NFC works however is not as fast as you would expect  Dual camera implementation could be better than current Random restarts are occurring of late\n",
      "It is a good phone I ever use phoneI used REDMI A1samsung but I love this phoneWhat I like Most about this phoneRAM  Just amazing Since it has 4GB of Ram and comes with an OS almost close to stock android there is more than enough for day to day usageProcessor  SD 625 is known for its efficiency and now I know why Smooth and lag free experience even when playing high end graphic games I have played MC5 and Asphalt so farScreen  Its awesome color reproduction is superb It feels as if Im using galaxy s6Call quality is top notch didnt face any issue so far On call volume is decent enoughBattery depends on users so there isnt much to discuss For me I would say its okish could have been better\n",
      "For 13K its value for moneySince Im coming from Nexus 5 thought the display could had been betterNot sure why the flash light theyve provided is warm color and not white led color like any other mobile This gives a different effect on the photos took with flash ON some may like it but I guess most wouldntEverything else is on par and the Moto gesture features are cool  handy\n",
      "In this range its best phone  Excellent gaming performance without any lag and long lasting battery backup You can use it for 2 days on normal consumption On heavy usage 10 hours which is quite sufficient Im bit worried of heat up issue Sometimes its very much though its rare Overall  mind blown phone\n",
      "Good looking phone but back of it is very slippery Have to be extra careful in handlingAlso what I didnt like is there was no instruction manual in it Not even starting up the phone\n",
      "This is the best mobile I have used till nowI liked below Camera Display Battery Even though its 3000mAH it gives one day with 100 charge RAMI didnt like Headset came with mobile its very cheap quality and sound clarity is very low Phone voice receiver volume could be better Felt little lessI am not heavy games player I am just normal mobile user\n",
      "Been using it four months Its not that good The dual camera doesnt take good pics in night or low lighting Even the daylight pics are not so greatProcessing has become slow in just three months Google maps take time to load whether on wifi or 4G networkNeedless to say the phone feels quite bulkyheavyBattery last for about 12 hoursThe original build is very slippery  definitely needs a cover with better grip to handle Otherwise it slips out and falls too oftenScreen size is good and viewing experience is good\n",
      "Pros1 Design and build quality is nice2 Stock android experience3 Display is crisp colors production is great4 Sound quality is niceCons1 Camera performance could have been better Sometimes captures blurry photo2 Priced a bit high for the hardware as there are no extra hardware advantage over the previous G5 plus3 No android updates4 Though it supports 4K recording but not that great with its image stabilization5 Battery is not much for heavy usage\n",
      "Love this Moto SD625 is doing wonders I being a heavy user from playing games for 4 hours daily and watching movies and surfing you tube  it goes completely for one day with around 20 of battery still left outFront camera is superb but the primary camera is just average Considering the dual camera still it doesnt take that good pics as compared to Remind Note 4 I am using note 4 for last 2 months But I think there is a lot to explore in camera so will post a revised review after one month of useFor those complaining on the missing E Compass It locks the location instantly without any issues M not sure if you are on a constant travel mode so complaining This phone is super fast n screen is awesomeI am happy to move from Moto G3 to Moto G5 S Plus\n",
      "Bought this phone 5 months ago and its working well One time charge can last for almost 1618 hours depending upon the data consumption Charges to 100 within 70 minutes when completely drained Rear cam is better compared to the front cam Earphones provided with the phone are not as good better get one of another brand Phone is slippery to hold with one hand phone cover must The body is robust even after falling 23 times no scratches or dents\n",
      "I bought this phone 2 weeks back As if now I am enjoy ung using this phone Only thing troubles me is the battery I was using redmi3s prime ratou er which was of 4300 mah battery and this us if 3000 mah battery So the battery life wise i am little discomfortable Turo charging is really a boom What if the charge suddenga fail a day Now I sm in that phase After 2 weeks of laage suddenly my phone charge stoppen working now Thats is what trigger es me to write this review friends think rice about battery before taking this phone Performance wise I give 5 out of 5 Awesome phone if you ignore battery issues\n",
      "Disadvantage 1 Mobile is getting heat up while using for long time2 Battery back up is also not good3 No update for Oreo 81 until July 20184 Notification LED is not available5 Little bulky than other mobile but its having metallic body So thats okAdvantage1 Processor is really fast2 Metal body look is adorable3 Camera quality is better than other phone in between range4 Picture Resolution is high5 Fingerprint sensor is really fast Best part is that mounted on front its also work as navigation key6 Turbocharger works pretty good\n",
      "I am using moto g5s plus for the past 5 months i am more than satisfiedThe camera is simply amazing with additional features like panorama and depth enabledThere is no need of a separate camera when we have moto in our handUsage is really good because of 4gb RAM Sound quality is excellent\n",
      "Received the product earlyBut there was problem with camera after 1 weekSo had demanded for replacementBut back panel of  replaced product had some scratchesFinally asked for refund but the amazon person came with invoice of earlier 1st one  phoneThis happened for 4 timesFinally didnt get refundUsing the same phoneBut one thing liked the phone software and working\n",
      "I dont have an option to give less than one ratingThe most funny part of Moto is it is struggling to OreoAndroid 8update for 2 year old and 1 year old devicesBut it has released the list of devices which gets PieAndroid 9Coming to the mobileWorst battery and very bad performanceCamera is less than an averageMoto is becoming worser day by day after Lenovo taken upProbably battery issue could be resolved some extent with OreoBut no Oreo update yet G5S plus users are annoyed waiting for the Oreo updateSound Ok ok\n",

      "Its a great phone for the price Purchased it for my father For his usage it is fast no lagging great battery backup and not to forget gets the updated androidCamera is great on the price you pay Compared to the competition on this price segment it has the best camera Love the Depth focus feature\n",
      "Been using it for a month now Awesome phone No lags at all Beter than all other phones in the price bracket But the dual camera is not that great The dual camera in mia1 is better than on the moto g5s plus But in all other segments the moto is much better than Mi The battery is good It lasts for around 1214 hours meaning of works for a day but needs a charge at night I have played many heavy games like shadow fight 3 and  asphalt 8 airborne and there are seriously no lags at all The phone heats up ab bit when it is charging but thats with all other fast charging phones so cant complain about that I love the chop chop and other gestures of the phone Really helpful The front camera is good is daylight conditions but the quality deteriorates when in artificial lighting conditions\n",
      "The finest that you will find The camera doesnt quite match with the hype it got but rest everything is top notch I was an iPhone user before but Moto G5s Plus made me forget apple and love Motorola Must buy if u want some extraordinary features in this price rangePS AMAZONS ONE DAY DELIVERY IS PATHETIC\n",
      "The purchase process at Amazon and the delivery went very smoothly within the committed time For the cashback VISA on the purchase it took some time and a followup which Amazon should try to streamline as it is an unecessary irritant The Product itself Moto G5sPlus is as per specs  reviews that I had studied online and largely fulfills my expectations The camera is good but is certainly below par compared to the specs and the hype Loud speaker sound quality is also disappointing The Moto software is relatively bare compared to RedMi Note 4  which I also ordered at the same time on Flipkart but that may also be the cause of the relatively shorter battery endurance of RedMi Note 4 though Moto G5s Plus battery also has a 25 higher mAh rating The moto is priced at about 60 premium on RedMi Note4 Rs 16000 Vs Rs 10000 which I find a bit too much for almost identical specs I also bought a Chevron hard backcase for the Moto which gives the Moto a solid look  feel\n",
      "Excellentbattery backup not up to the expectation good quality cameraFront camera not up to the mark super build quality turbo charging is very promising\n",

      "I ordered this phone just before one day of launch and got this very next day Thank you amazon for superfast deliveryComing to phone I ordered it as my primary phone but recently i have started using it as secondary phone and as per me the performance is satisfactory I will not tell the technical details but yes will write the things that i observed and can cause trouble1 Phone camera lags badly in depth mode hoping for a software update from Motorola2 Sometime apps crashes when you are using them3 Phone call quality is good but speaker volume is less4 Battery works pretty fine with heavy usage you can get phone working for a full day5 Photos taken from camera are crisp and you can record 4k video as well But camera bump on back is not a good idea6 Phone feels slippery without cover7 Fingerprint sensor is amazingly fast8 Phone heats up while charging this could be due to turbi charging but not very sure9  Screen quality is pretty impressiveRest apart phone is good not great but at this price what you will expect  \n",

      "Its been month only when I hold this phone I felt very good that time because it gives you prime feeling prima facie but after some time I started realising that its touch is not good as it was month ago it has started lagging and some time hangs too its sensors and hardwares are below average thats why its performance is below average Dont buy thisgo buy dummy phone but dont buy this\n",
      "Ok I am writing my review after using this phone for almost 50 daysNo separate folders for camera photos and for songs Radio also not get the signal or not accepting the Indian stationsHeat issue is there  I was using a phone has mediatek processor and it has the heating issue so I decided to buy snapdragon but the issue remains the sameCamera inspite of having the dual camera performance is less than the averageHang issue is also there and not that much fast what I was expecting in snapdragon processorThe back side camera is too much out from the surface so I need to take precautions while keeping down\n",
      "The product was delivered as described The build quality is good and sturdy The camera is good maybe not excellent for many but good for this price range There is no lag and runs multiple functions simultaneously The display legibility is good at normal light but not that good at sunlight the sound quality is good for speaker and headphone too In all a good product at this price range\n",
      "Meseging app not working i will meet my oprator store tomorrow and if not fix that issue i have to repplace instrumentNow its workingsms because i change simcard to nano vodafone resume sms service after 28 hoursInstrument is ok nice colour and build fast tooOnly i font like on moto is big camere windoOtherwise very cute phone\n",

      "Before purchasing I was wondering ifThis phone was if it looks better than the MotoG5Plus Yes it really does look very nice allmetal build Feels very solid in handDoes it have any lag None which I could noticeIs the Camera any good It takes decent pictures very good for a person like me not a photography enthusiast\n",
      "Within two days i started facing issue with touchSometimes it works  sometime doesnt  specially top area I tried two phone both have same issue with touch Touch doesnt work on top area You wont be able to open your apps which are in first rowLenevo ruined MotorolaBetter go with other brand except lenevo and Motorola now no longer best mobile brand\n",
      "I have read few reviews about the overheating issue for this phone Was Little dubious initially Looks like they are all correct about over heating during turbo charging Having said that the rest of the features are quite outstanding when compared to its competitors Quite a winner in its segment\n",
      "Purchased this mobile from Amazon on 19th March 2017 Picture quality is really good The 2nd best camera phone after Redmi note 5 pro if your budget is below 15K Sound quality display and overall performance of the mobile is really good Good mobile for heavy game users Only con is that the battery life is poor but that con is not a major problem as moto g5s plus comes with a turbocharger which charges your phone from 0100 within 1 hrsHighly recommended if your budget is below 15K and youre looking for a mobile which has a good brand name \n",
      "Contacts can only be saved to Google mail Id There is no option for saving the contact on phone memory There should be an option in the hands of user where heshe wants to save It should not be forced which is not customer friendly Rear camera output is not that good as said or publicised Front camera output is still better Processing is not that fast Only plus point is 64gb internal memory Overall it is just a normal phone Cost seems to be bit on higher side Buying Moto g 5s with external memory card can b better option at much lower costThink twice  compare fr better deal Company is just twisting  presenting things differentlyThanks\n",
      "Best phone in price 16000Camera is Good not like DSLR but its average good cameraSpeed of the mobile is incomparable with this range look is also good touch is awesome sensor is awesome best thing is turbo charging from 0 to 100 it takes 1 hr 42 minsAnd 3000 mAh is sufficient for one day display is very good brightness is good and main thing is dont expect too much from camera camera is good also I dont say camera is bad but dont expect too much from camera\n",
      "Its been one month i m using this phone and really Motorola disappoints me in the camera field in the comparison of Mi A1 the camera is not upto markAlthough the built quality and processor is goodEarlier i m using Moto g4 plus which was really a good phone but i think Moto g5s plus is not a major upgrade instead of that phonePhone Doesnt heat that much while in heavy gaming and charging too and battery optimization is really good you can use almost 12 hours with Data usage with full battery chargeThe major upgrade of Dual cameraBookeh effect is not upto  mark even after 2 updates of motorola camera Hope so Motorola fix it as soon as possible but i reccommend if you want to upgrade your phone for main reason of camera go for mi A1 and if you are a Moto fan like me Go for this Phonetell me in comments if this is helpful for you or Not\n",
      "After 1 years of usingProMoto has given many camera updates and potriat improvementsPhoto quality in day light is decentTurbo Charging at its best till nowConPromised that they will give oreo update within 4 months but till now they havent givenApp crashes rarelyPoor picture quality at night\n",
      "Im using this phone from around 1 month and my review for this phone is as followPerformancetoo fast no doubt 4 gb ram is working really goodCamera  amazing debth mode is also too good but it is not good as iphone 7 but it really captures great images and while recording videos the video stabilization works great which is lacking in mi a1Batteryturbo charging is damn too fast  and the battery backup is is quite decent it can long for one day\n",
      "Its so good product no heating issue no hanging issue so fast we can say just next to iPhone but the only thing is that camera is good only in daylight only its not good at night so who wants to go to photo shoot at night I would suggest you to take your camera or good diffuesd light with you so that you can capture good pictures of your moments\n",
      "Best phone I purchased in my lifePhone camera is too good if compare to Redmi A1The metallic design is awesomePrice is very lowPhone battery is not too much but easily we can spend a dayPhone charges very fast as it support turbo chargingI dont have words to express this phone because the phone quality  features and design is awesomeIf you have budget of 16000 then go for itit worth it\n",
      "Awesome phone if u use This phone u just love it design wise it looks like iPhone apple phone camera quality is superb nd the internal device is u got approx 51 gb and ram 36 gb is used which is far better than any other phone in this range awesome phone take selfie or anything u just love it with this cameralittle bit battery capacity is lowbut most important thing is the turbo charger which charge the phone in just 1 hr completely \n",
      "Im a moderate user I liked the device very much performance is fluid and smoothIm satisfied with the cameraOnly thing i did not like is its battery  I feel they should have given a bit more bigger battery considering the screen sizeAlthough it runs a full day but it could have been better \n",
      "Best phone at an affordable range I choose this over Xiaomi Mi A1 I like the speed the screen resolution the sound qualitysuprisingly and my favourite the fingerprint sensor It is very fast and almost recognises immediately I like the fingerprint sensor in the front rather than in the back because when you are working and your phone is lying on the desk and you need to unlock it you dont have to pick the phone Just press the fingerprint sensor That is super convenient Moto actions are convenient The camera is not that impressive considering it is 1313 Mp Talking about the battery charging is very fast due to the turbo charger and the battery last fairly a day but if you use you phone extinsevely for watching videos online or heavy gaming it will last upto maximum 14 hours Hope this helps\n",
      "I am reviewing after 6 month phone is good and working satisfactory But my phone stop charging and I visited to service centre Chandigarh they told me that charging jack not working and if I want to repair that whole motherboard will change and that cost will be around 13000  second day I shown to a local repair centre he told me that nothing is broken and h repaired phone easily Lenova is immorse the name of Motorola\n",
      "Everything is good only two problems are there1 wifi gets disconnected when I connect it to my Dell laptop  And it happens within 1 minut of connection and after that it only gets connected and disconnected My laptop connects with each and every wifi except moto g5splus2camera is only for day time and good light  Not a good camera but average quality pics are taken by it in medium to low light3 speaker are loud ohh sorry loudest of any android I purchased till now and yes speaker sound is that much loud that sometime sound has some cracks and irritation in it\n",
      "I bought this with an exchange for my Redmi 3s Prime which I used for around a year and three months I got a good exchange price for that from Amazon around 4400 bucks which is almost 50 of what I had purchased it for I also got around 1000 bucks off on hdfc card eventually I paid 8600 bucks which I think is a steal deal The phone is very well built and looks premium The features are also pretty good especially the gestures I think Moto phones are great value for money Thanks Amazon\n",
      "Good built quality diaplay is great but Moto has to improve more in software updates It seems to be slow in getting Android updates  offline mapsGPS does work just because this phone does not have ecompass in it Rest all is fine nothing much say about Screen cast does not work at all  also the camera bump glass is broken now\n",
      "writing my review after 4 months of usagepros1 Smooth performance2Ram management is awesomewe can easily run 10 apps in background3after the recent updates camera has updated alot4great battery backup with turbo charger5Snapdragon 625  cortex A53 makes the device run smooth cons1 no oreo update till nowmoto is becoming lazy these days2it slightly heats during charging but its not a mojor problemi think it heats up due to turbo charger\n",
      "Its working pretty good As per my expectationsBt there is no thing like Fast battery charging its just normalBt all other things like camera screen speaker volume Fingerprint scanner battery backupeven design are very goodBt you just need to buy a back cover for that camera bump\n",
      "A nice phone under 20k bucks Feels really premium thanks to the metal body design It is sleek yet comfortable to hold Camera is great but you need to be carefull with the camera glass Depth mode is so so Not as great as that you would get from DSLRs well thats an obvious For that DSLRs are there in the market But the depth mode acts great if the object is closer to camera and has a crisp boundary line against the background and overall it acts better than any other third party apps This phone would definitely attract attention of others looks wise There is a camera bump at the back which would make you feel extra cautious at the beginning and would make you search a softer surface to keep your phone but this can be taken care of by using a back cover Battery is good I would say 100 charge at 7am would last till 800pm till you get 15 charge warning It gets turbo charging and charger with it Let me tell you to get 45 hours battery backup in 15 mins you need to switch off your phone And guess what it doesnt heat up Doesnt have lagging issues as well If you have a budget upto 20k would recomend you this phone\n",
      "PROS  speedy performance   high quality cameras  with slow motion  and pro mode    Full metal unibody  beautifully designed  and coloured unlike most MOTOs its  quite slim    Great battery life  3000 mAh    Above average processor   Quick finger print scanner   Cornering gorrila glass   Full HD display   Turbo ChargerCONS Camera bulge need to be protected from  being scratched   Hybrid sim slot dont allow to have 2 SIMsmemory card\n",
      "looking to good battery backup is awesome front camera is awesome and  rear camera also memory is too good 64 gb it is enough major problem is that when we use dual sim mode mode i escape my external memory card and when we use memory card we confermise my 2 sim because at a single time i can access only 1 sim and 1 memory card at a time it to major problem but mobile is too good\n",
      "Pros1 Speeddating the speed of doing things is good You can quickly switch to different apps without any lag2 Camera the dual camera works good 360 panorama is as good as it gets The clicked panorama moves as you move your phone so it is pretty well3 Display the display is very clear You cannot see any pixelsgrains so the picturesvideo are crisp4 Speaker the speaker is loud enough to be heard in a room I have seen reviews on sites which say that it isnt loud but I see nothing like that Its pretty loudConsThe only thing that troubles sometimes is the size of phone You may find a bit of issue while touching the screen at different corners if you have small hands Otherwise its good\n",
      "Highly satisfied with the product Excellent camera Equalant to a basic DSLR cam effect For people who seek basic functionality  good camera  this is the one Gaming speed  multi function is awesome Worth for every penny paid\n",
      "This is as much one can expect from a budget phone I donot know why few people are giving one star but this is worth it Camera in depth mode is bit laggy but that apart everything else seems to be good For such a big phone with just 3000 mah it easily lasts a day So I donot know what is the expectation of people giving 1 or 2 strar For 15k do they expect DSLR level camera\n",
      "The product is goodIt has good battery backup4GB ram provides smoother performanceShould be careful with the rear camera bumpAmazon Please dont fool customers by showing wrong price rangeThe phone s real price is 16k but you are showing off like you are selling a 20k product\n",
      "Android Pie just came and I havent yet received OreoI bought this one as they said its a stock Android but after series of security updates its not stock anymore Plus havent received Oreo update yet as they had promised even those security updates are infrequentThe device is slippery falls off easily Mi A1 provides much better camera with less price than this one doesPros Turbo charging good battery backup\n",
      "Really great phone for this price range The build is top notch similar to a flagship device Sturdy unibody metallic build which is great to hold The camera is sharp in daylight as well as medium light conditions Stock Android is another highlight which makes the phone completely unbloated\n",
      "Luvd d phone very smooth  ND d pics r awsum wid dizbt a bit on d warmmer side which I dont mind Only problem wid d hybrid slot Where in Sim slot 1 jio 4g doesnt shows d volte feature bt Sim slot 2 memory card slot does but Dan u cant use d memory card\n",
      "Amazon Delivery was poor but the phone is okayCamera is average compared to other dual camera phones Its good in day light but not anything outstanding I am satisfied with the performanceCompared to Motos other phones in this range this one has good looks too so if you are planning to buy a good reliable phone in this range and is not a photography maniac you can definitely go for this one Battery backup is more than 24 hours for normal use\n",
      "Mobile is Good but battery not up to the mark I Also own MIA1 its battery is better but Moto has fast turbo chargerbut one WORST thing is its headphone which is of very cheap quality also not good in terms of volume and beats and last but not the least there is lots of material saving or cost cutting charger is of low quality and wire is too short about mobile will again update after few days till now mobile is best\n",
      "First impression is awesome Built quality is awesome The Camera seems good Overall performance with apps and gaming seems flawlessThe finger print sensor is  one the best in class with multiple navigation capabilitiesHoping to get a better performance for depth enabled mode in the camera shutter lag fix and a better edge detection But given the price range this is still good\n",
      "One of the most reliable phones in the market We have 3 My moms dad and brother all use Gs5 Very happy with the performance and service\n",
      "Im using it for the last 7 months Prior to that I used a Xiomi Note 3 Recently I started having issues with the device charging First even when connected to the Turbo Charger phone was showing 12 hrs to complete charge but when you charge with the phone off it was charging completely in 1 hr 45 mins I called up Motorola Support and they asked me to factory reset I did and it started working fine Second now the Turbo Charger it self conked out Well I think its not worth the additional premium you pay for this phone against its nearest competitors\n",
      "Awesome PhoneI really Liked The Phone very mch rear both cameras are awesome depth pics are superb and looks like that the pics are taken from a DSLRFront camera is also good and takes good picsLittle bit of heating problem but its normal as many phone gets heated during charging  useingTurboPower Charger is charing the phone very quicklyAll Over The Phone Is Suberb Awesome  And also Felling Good While Using this phone\n",
      "Actually I got a serious issue of charging It took 67 hrs to became full charged So I had to go to service centre they told its a common problem of charging wire data cable So they replace that and now it takes 1hr and 40 to 50 min to be full chargedOver all its a nice phone with some interesting features like slow motion video recording  nice design etc\n",

      "Its a good phone Im using it since last month  I found some minor bugs like its flash stops working sometimes and we have to restart our phone to turn on flash  some more issues but overall performance is good  I received a torned package with honey spreaded on the box actually it was due to another package which was containing honey and the jar was cracked Thats the main issue \n",

      "Day 2 of use so not tested completely My previous phone was the Moto x style so moving to this was easy The X Style was great while it lasted but the battery was horrible It used to heat up too much  and drain very quickly Hopefully will not face too many problems with thisUsing multiple apps at the same time is a breeze with the 4gb ram Photos taken even at night came out pretty good though a little washed out as I had to increase the brightness before I took themMost reviews said the phone didnt have NFC but it doesBuild quality is really good and the screen is great I really dont see myself moving to an Amoled screen Fingerprint sensor works like a charm Happy with my new phone\n",
      "This mobile is very good Though I got a defective piece but Amazon as always they are ready to replace Overall Im happy Everything is good especially the fast charging camera is average Performance is superb\n",
      "Works flawlessly No issues Wasnt charging at all at first but after installing all the software updates fast charging works properly Tends to get a little warm after about 1520 mins of constant usage due to which the palm sweats a little and the phone gets a little slippery But if you use a back cover then there wont be a problem Phone is a bit on the heavier side but you get used to it in a couple of daysOverall the phone works great doesnt hang at all Heavy games like asphalt 8 run smoothlyCamera is good not very good though\n",

      "Got this product before the estimated delivery date thanks to Amazon for fast delivery I got this phone 9000 bucks with exchange offer Coming to the phone its just an awesome device Its far better than Redmi note 5 pro if you can manage with 169 screen instead of 189 screen aspect ratio The camera is slightly better in Redmi note 5 pro but instead of this we are getting lot more in Moto g5s plus like good speaker more vibrant display fast charging good battery life A brand stock android experience timely OTA updates and lot more and the most important it wont blast  what else you wantJust go for it\n",
      "Great performance and Ram management Battery backup seems okay for 15 daysCamera not upto the mark especially in low light But it has many features They continue to improve camera with updates Camera bump at rear means additional careI would have preferred amoled to ips display But its not a big issueFingerprint unlock works really well Best feature for me is the one touch navigationGood phone But fast getting outdated with the upcoming Moto G6 and also the oreo update for newer phones\n",
      "Not a soo great product Not so fast like 2ghz as company claiming as I am facing mobile getting slow while usingHeating issueCamera user interface is worstCamera is dual but i doubt one camera is just a dummy lens as when I covered one lens with cloth there was nothing visible in screen so I think only one camera is workingBattery back up is also not soo good If you reacharge 100  also maximum I am getting half day battery backup with medium usage such as playing music and checking internetTotally its a worst experience for me\n",
      "I have been using this phone for 1 month and Im totally happy with the performance with the phone but I dont capture too many pics so Im not concern about the camera but all in one phone You can buy It but if youre a Samsung person then its far better then Samsung My recommendation is that you can buy this phone without hesitation but first have a look ok Redmi A1Android One Camara quality of that phone is comparing to this phone if youre curious about camera then that phone is also good Im happy with the Moto G5s plus it meets my requirements\n",

      "Its a decent phone Im impressed with the charging it is quite fast But since it has a metal back it can get pretty hot if you do some heavy gpu or cpu intensive work like gaming The bulge from the camera in the back feels a bit weird but youll get used to itOne problem is that the fingerprint scanner works even when your phone is locked So if I touch the fingerprint sensor with my elbow it will register and show error So its kind of annoying I wish they activated the fingerprint sensor only when the phone is awakeOtherwise this phone is great for the price\n",
      "The phone is amazing Early delivered by Amazon Nicely packed Light weighted phone no lagging issues camera is good built quality is also good class phone at this price Thanks Moto  Amazon \n",
      "Its a good mobile from MotorolaLoud speakersPremium lookCamera is little bit slow while capturing shots with depth enable modeGood Battery backupSmooth performanceOverall i like this mobile just go for it if you intrested to buy this mobile\n",
      "First of all buy it from Amazon for a very low priceThe phone feels premium in hand because of its metal body make and is powerpacked with a 2 GHz clockspeed qualcomm chipsetThe only con is that it doesnt have a compass sensorThe camera comes with the professional as well as depth mode which really helps capture good photosBattery is 3000 mah which is a decent oneTipGet a good back cover as early as possible to protect the camera bump from scratches and damagesOverallworth spending 12 k for such a device\n",
      "Excellent Phone in this range and segmentNo heating problem even when we are browsing or playing gamesCamera quality is good for both rear and frontThe only area I am expecting a better performance is  Battery backup  its coming for a day even for a moderate users If we use much applications which use location  you may have to carry the charger along with youBTW  its a Turbo quick charger which is another advantage\n",
      "I m not satisfied your this product because I have many issues facing in my handset Charger Cable is Not Working from phone purchased 2 month after Finger Print is Not Working properly  Network issues in my handset Some time Phone systems stopped automatically heating Issues  automatically calling time phone switch off  etc  I really tell you dear when I look for advertising that time Im very happy to see Motorola G5s plus is very nice handset but I tell you that time I m very frustrated  I have very nice experience im used many Motorola phonesPlease do the reply Im waiting for your good AnswerThankAnurag9821206243\n",
      "For this price you CANNOT get this combination of hardware and software There are many other phones that are cheaper with better specs like Xiaomi but they have absolute crap UI This one has near stock Android Something every Android user likes\n",
      "I have used both the g5 plus and the g5s plusIn first lookThe g5s plus is just same as g5 plus apart from the build quality and the larger screen sizeThe performance is also the sameBut these time there is bloatware includedAnd the colour for the moto display is fixed to blue and that was quite disappointingThe battery is capable for a day just like g5 plusAnd the turbocharger sure helps a lotThe camera is not what i expected it needs improvments on both front and the rear Images from the Front camera gets dark when its exposed to light which many other camera in price bracket does but it was absent on the g5 plusAnd the low light capability is horrible While the rear camera is more sharper than g5 plus but it lacks the brightness of g5 plus and the rgb sensor only works the other one is only for depth measuring I believe that these issues could be solved by updatesApart from the camera this I a solid product\n",
      "A really good budget phoneVery good speakersGood cameraSmooth switching between appsUsing it from past 2 months Still no lag I hope it remains the sameIf youre looking for a good phone under 16k I think you should definitely go for this oneAll the best\n",
      "The phone is too goodits build quality is marvelous Performance is very snappy and plays almost any game thrown at it camera is also very good takes decent pictures even in low lightthe external speaker is so loud I was blown away Call quality is decent Battery could easily last for one day with moderate usefast charging rocksoverall a very good phone in this price range Must buy if you like it\n",
      "Its a decent phone at this price I bought the product for 13k and its worth it Camera is decent not as great as shown in the advertisements The speed is on the slower side but you cant expect everything to be great in a phone at 13kdisplay is finelooks more than decent and 64gb internal memory is good enough to store most of the data battery lasts one full day if you dont use this phone for gaming or watching videostouch is pretty responsive and fingerprint reader is also fine Nothing great about the phone but nothing bad either A decent phone at this price\n",
      "I got this phone yesterday and everything is awesome processor is very fast sound is very loud battery is great for one day with normal use and turbo charger charge is quite fast it charge the phone fully form 0 to 100 in 1 hour 40 min only problem is with camera its slow but I think that can resolved with an update and now Moto also confirm the O android update thats great I really love the phone and waiting for this type of phone\n",
      "Build and design are awesome in terms of camera it dont satisfy my expectation  i dont know may be i expect too much I  was using moto g4 plus  as compare to it moto g5 s plus doesnt  beat  in terms of camera i think g4 plus does better in front cam Still good phone though\n",
      "Please note its 2months im using it  and I already started facing issue with the 355mm jack  headphones not working in this jack at times I have tested the headphones on all other phones it is perfectly working Also the phone do not work in compass  they donot have the compass specific sensors Rest all are okI would suggest you go for Mi A1 than this but if you want radio mandate then only go for this keeping in mind my above points\n",
      "Good phone with all around performance However I feel there are some issues need to be taken care1 Notification light although available works only in case of extremely low battery For other use one has to root the phone2 Screen casting in smart TV is an issue which was pretty easy with my previous Lenovo phone3 Hybrid sim slot No dedicated slot for memory card\n",
      "The camera is too bad it is like 5 MP rather 13mp dual camera And mobile is getting heat up too much while charging I have contacted the technician they are it is built as per Motorola standards I havent thought Motorola standards will be like this especially for the camera Those who want camera clarity dont choose this the smartphones under 10k are giving more clarity than this My sincere request is to not to go for this who wants to have the camera\n",
      "This phone I bought for my wife Look and feel is really good Great camera Sound quality also nice while watching movies or playing games it produces enough sound While charging or keeping in hand for longer time it gets little heated up as it has full metal bodyIt feels premium\n",

      "The performance and battery is very good 1313 mp dual camera has not impressed me This phone supports 2 sim card or 1 sim card  1 memory card So you need a back cover and hybrid sim adapter to be able to use 2 sim card  1 memory card\n",

      "The camera software cannot white balance correctly while shooting indoors or using flash There is a significant yellow tint in the photos especially on the skin tones Neither the Amazon technical team or the Motorola Support Center acknowledged this issue If you are buying the phone for good quality photographs you will stand disappointedHopefully Motorola corrects this in their future software upgrades\n",
      "Phone is awesome good battery backup and processor is handling the applications very well  camera is the only thing that made me worry about although its not bad and for this range I think thats good but making it with the dual rear camera it should deliver some what good camera clarity although day light images are good overall I ll give 78 for camera and 87 for the phone performance looks battery backup\n",
      "I am using this phone since last two months I overall phone quality is very good Battery quality is good enough to stand for 24 hours after standard usage I found the phone function smoothly during multitasking and heavy gaming experience Camera quality isnt very satisfactory but not even below standard within same category I found  this phone worth purchasing within this price rangeSudip BhattacharyyaKolkata\n",

      "I have had no issues with this phone the phone does heat during charging but almost every phone with quick charging feature has that problemNo lags the camera is average but you get what you pay for Only thing that should be kept in mind is that there is no tempered glass available in the market which fits the phone perfectly they are all small in sizeAlso the phone looks premium especially the back\n",

      "The camera is not as described in ads Its too slow to respond in normal mode also forget bokeh effect mode Its disappointing to see that Motorola is not interested in any update to resolve the issue The security patch is also old june 2017 Apart from it everything is fine\n",
      "After purchasing Moto g3 and using that phone for straight 2 years  thought to purchase same company phone Moto g5s plus was my worst decision to do  battery charging is a problemphone got dead on 2nd day and Amazon refused to return back as they say phone is not working we cannot trace EMI I should have went for court but gave to service centre turbo charger worked for a month then it takes 3 hours for full chargeAnd on top of that amazon gave me defect piece and refused to return it back Wont buy any electronic from Amazon again\n",
      "Disappointed Expected it to be an upgrade from Moto G4S plusThe back of the phone is very slippery  your only choice is risk breaking it or get an ugly cover to make it thicker and heavierWeight is more than G4SVoice quality on phone call is poorer as compared to G4S plusCamera is superior to G4SOverall not very pleased with the performance\n",
      "This phone doesnt have magnetometer Hence it doesnt support the compass related apps like skyview magnetic compass Also google maps will not move as per your movement in terms of directions\n",
      "Here is my review after 10 days usesThis phone is bestest phone I was ever looking for  From every side like camera  battery  performance and everything  Before buying this I was Soo confused between Moto G5S plus  MiAi but this phone made me realize that I was Soo rightDont think guys just go for this phone\n",
      "Not happy with the service of lenevo Charger got burnt within two days of buying the mobile I went to the service centre to get it changed They said we have to update the software to change the charger All my data would be lost If that was my mobile I would have returned the phone That was for my father who didnt like getting it exchanged so we have to update the software When there is problem with charger why update the software\n",
      "It is one of the worst handsets I bought and motorlloa service has been really pathetic to say the least Gifted this handset to my father and there was an issue with the speaker right of the bat  sent it to service centre and they determined there is no water or physical damage and said they will get it fixed still after testing they refused to fix someinternal Ic issue as its something that they cannot fix horrible service I would really ask everyone to stay away from Motorola and if I can get an escalation email that will be great\n",
      "Each smartphone have its pros and cons Please refer below pros and consProsPure Android experience with moto apps featuresUniversally unlocked by defaultGood displayCall quality is goodBattery long last per day with normal uses and having turbo charging facilityPerformance and memory management is goodConsDefault Video calling is missing but you can use 3rd party appsWhile charging phone is getting hotcamera clarity and photo capture issueinfrared and compass sensor is not available but not found any issue while using mapgps navigation while travellingStill used micro USB instead of Typec portDolbey atom is missingOverall as per price I will recommend to buy this phone but as per your need\n",
      "Day1  Heating problem as soon as it was plugged into chargerDay1 evening after all updates done restarting in loop Day2morningIt went dead after multiple attempts not powering ON Amazon promised to send a technician to check the issue Day 2 Afternoon powered ON and showing 47 battery but still restarting in loops so took a micromax fone and put my sim card now life seems to be fineMay be a defunct product as i have been using motorla from long time never faced such issues before Is it the quality of motorola has been compromised by Lenovotime to think over the same\n",
      "I bought this phone in June 2018 At first it was working perfectly No issues at all battery life was brilliant and would charge super fast However since yesterday the battery is acting really weird When I put it on charge it starts discharging instead tried using a different charger too One second it shows 23 and within less than a second it says 99 On restarting it goes back to 30 It is within warranty  but extremely shocking that within  just ONE month of buying the phone Im facing this problem Expected so much more from Moto\n",
      "Pathetic phone dont go for Motorola phone Before buying go and check on Lenovo forrum so many problem Poor connectivity poor ingress protection everybody having this phone can check there will be dust accumulated on rear camera lens If you ask Lenovo guys they will ask you to go to service center where problem will be solved for that day and again after 45 days you can found dust on lens it wont if you use this phone in air conditioned places so dont go for it\n",
      "Shocked to find software problem just out of the box Be careful of updating I tried to and all sorts of error messages came up After a lot of sweat set the mobile back to factory mode I have lost the thrill of having a new cellphone\n",
      "Not very happy with the user interface  compare to the LENOVO Vibe used immediately before this one Couldnt locate an audio recording facility  trying to find a quality reliable one from Play store  Not very comfortable  Couldnt recommend this one Sorry\n",
      "The charger stopped working last week I went to the Motorola service centre with the charger for replacement but they need the phone cable and charger all to be brought together Should have been simple to check the charger with any other phone and cable I guess they just want to avoid any action under warranty since it will cost quite a bit to go to the service center specifically for this and the customer might probably not visit the neighbourhood for the next six months on other workPoor service Motorola\n",
      "i purchased it with lot of interest and enthusiasm but for my astonishment its camera is very bad no clarity even though its dual flash waste waste waste but moto g4plus is good i used it previously  based on the same experience i purchased it but total disappointment\n",
      "Amazon refused to take it backalso Motorola guys refused to take it backHotspot not working from 1st day of purchaseworst service ever by MotorolaSERVICE CENTRE  guys in Chandigarh made false promisesthey wasted my 10 days and still could not solve the problem There is no heirarchy escalation for Motorola device defects I asked them to provide their seniors contact numbers or emails they refusedBluetooth gets activated on its ownAnd now 4 months later charger is not workingWill never buy Moto in future\n",
      "Review for the phone can be found else where as it is generic this is about the product and delivery in amazon The product was delivered on time and works well No issues found with the device\n",
      "The worst service for the phone from Motorola From the initial months of purchase there is lot of problem with phone every time they forced me to visit service center for resolutionThey made me visit more than 15times still getting problems wid phone and they are not ready to exchange itVery poor build quality\n",
      "Not at all up to the expectations The phone has serious design flaw The protruding camera is a real pain You have to be very careful while placing the phone anywhere3 weeks of usageBattery is drainingDust getting inside the sealed packed camera lense no idea howI have already been to service center twice for charging related issuesNOT WORTH 1314k rangeUPDATERear Camera quality keeps deteriorating\n",
      "It have hybrid sim slot you can use 2sim or 1 sim and sd cardAfter 4 Month of uses Ill not prefer this phone becoz of it started hanging and it turn to slow even after reset of factory settings and the worse thing is that it have battery draining problem and its power saving mode is totally useless Battery performance same as without power saving mode battery will drain same\n",
      "3 stars for some of the issues1Proximity sensor is poor need to hold your phone very near to your  ears and face Literally touching2 All sim cards Network suddenly disappeares and cant not be searched again from cellular network because it gets disabled from that menu  when no sim card found comes You have to restart phone every time you lost the network3 Back camera is not much good in the low light or in the evening night pictures are not clear at all  HDR is poor My Nexus 5 HDR beats this phones HDR anytime4 Only positive thing is battery and processor\n",
      "The phone battery is draining when I am charging with Motorolas official charger Once I have charged my phone when it is having 21 battery after some time it switched off automatically and when I restarted my phone it showed me 59 charge So please help me to solve this issue And please let me know where is the problem either in my phone or in my charger\n",
      "One star less for the disappointing cameraDual camera doesnt work much good even in proper lighting Depth effect and single camera also not great in comparison to other phoneRedmi A1If dual camera is your main factor to buy this please avoid this one\n",
      "The device got scratched within 2 days  Though I had the same handset before this it did not scratch after 6 months also but this one did within 2 days  Im very unhappy about this  I think I got a faulty one\n",
      "This mobile is the worst I bought so far1 The dual camera is not even produces results better than old single lens phone2 Native video facility is not provided which is very essential support now a days3 The video color quality is not appreciableSo many other things like compass speedometer etcare not provided4 Music player and gallery is not provided5 Sometimes the screen becomes partly black due to unknown reasons\n",
      "defective product given by the seller  tedious process of replacementthey are not ready to replace the phone thought expert visit team had given replacement reportevery time i call customer care they give different reasons sometime address deactivated or product not available even though it is shown on the website as available if you want to avoid tedious process of replacement replacement is not guaranteed  mental stress best is to buy in shoppe\n",
      "Battery backup screen fingerprint sensor is good But camera Call quality and mic are bad My voice is not heard with the internet on Looks like a software and hardware issue Camera software is bad and image looks under exposed most of the times Didnt live up to the expectation This is my second Moto and will be my last one Disappointed\n",
      "I am using this since last three months it hangs sometimes  Before it I used Moto G2 having only 1 gb ram but working smoothly than Moto gs 5 plusLenovo reduce the quality of Moto Bad experience with LenovoNow never by Lenovo manufactured product\n",
